            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And not ignorant how greatly it auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and how ſingularly it profiteth euery maner of way; in ſo great diuerſitie, and as

<pb facs="tcp:19545:4"/> apparent; that ſimple and vnlearned men by the plaine deliuerie of wholeſom doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine might the better be edified; that all occaſion of ſurmiſed difference, &amp; all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of contrarietie betwixt S. <hi>Iames,</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Paul,</hi> might be remoued.</p>
            <p>Which epiſtle I hauing finiſhed, and run ouer, in a plaine methode, in an eaſie order, in ſuch a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, as might beſt ſerue for the inſtruction of the ſimple; and by occaſion intimating and ſignifying ſo much vnto certaine learned preachers of the citie; they forthwith perſuaded me to beſtow ſome labor to put in writing that, which by worde of mouth I had preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; &amp; to ſet forth publikely, what priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I had vttered to my ſpeciall charge and people: aſſuring mee, that there would therehence redound and riſe profit to the common-wealth and church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Whereunto at the firſt I could not be perſuaded to agree; neither might I be brought to condeſcend vnto their honeſt requeſt, fearing the ſharpe cenſure and hard iudgement of thoſe men, whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pleaſeth but that, which is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for wit, ſingular for learning, rare for
<pb facs="tcp:19545:4"/> knowledge, perfect and polliſhed with all varietie of things, and ornaments of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: taught in like manner, through practiſe of time, vſe of things, trial of long experience, that in theſe latter and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous daies, whereinto we are fallen by the will of God: men flowe, ſwarme, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where abound; which either ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their owne time in idleneſſe, vanitie and ſlouthfulneſſe; either ſtudious of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; yet enuying as it were, common vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and profite; will neither ſet forth any thing themſelues to doe good to others: neither like of the labours, ſtudies, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, and trauels of other men. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they either teare them with the ſharp teeth of bitter backbiting: or ſtinge them with the venemous tongue of reprochful ſlaunder: or ſtrike them with the heauie rodde of vndeſerued reprehenſion: or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally wound the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the bloudie ſword of malicious defamation.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this; at length, partly moued by Chriſtian dutie; partly drawen on by brotherly entreatie; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allured with hope, that by this labour it may pleaſe God, that I may winne at

            <p>Laying therfore aſide the greater part of former feare, and ſetting at light the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reprehenſions of thoſe <hi>Momi,</hi> and malitious perſons, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing pleaſeth, but what is picked out of their owne fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ends; framed by their owne braines; imagined of their owne heads, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by themſelues: whoſe reprochfull cenſure, who ſo regardeth, ſhall neuer bring to light any thing, though it be moſt excellent, without quarrell-picking, fault-finding, ſharpe reprouing, vtter condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: hauing the publike profite of many, and the eternall glory of God (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ſcope &amp; end of all my labours) alwaies before my eies, I bente my ſelfe to publiſh this trauell in writing: not as a
<pb facs="tcp:19545:5"/> thing ſingular aboue all other things: for alas, how farre is it from that? but as a thing (I doubt not) profitable to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; a light to the argument handled, a way to prouoke others of greater talents to the enterpriſing of greater matters: and a thing I hope helpfull to thoſe that ſhall throughly peruſe it.</p>
            <p>Which (right reuerende Father) I thought good to offer and dedicate to your good Lordſhip: beſeeching your honour for your accuſtomable curteſie, to take well in worth this teſtimonie of my minde (to ſpeake the leaſt) not euill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards you: and hartily deſiring you, for your vſuall humanitie, to let theſe firſt fruites of my trauell, paſſe vnder your protection, patronage and paſport. Whom I haue choſen one of many, for this purpoſe, becauſe at two ſeueral times, not knowen by face vnto your Lordſhip, I haue tried and taſted of your worthie curteſie, your fatherly grauitie, tempered with no leſſe gentlenes and facilitie.</p>
            <p>Since which times, I haue thought (by what meanes I could) to leaue with you ſome teſtimonie of my well willing
<pb facs="tcp:19545:6"/> affection towardes you. That you might the better know, both in what eſtimation I alwaies haue had you for your learning, wiſdome and grauitie; for your gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, curteſie, and humanitie: and how much I do, &amp; will reuerence you for your godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if with what my labour, with ſuch profite to the church of Chriſt, this worke ſhalbe publiſhed: &amp; if I know that it is both fauourably allowed of you, and curteouſly accepted of the brethren: I will not onely greatly reioyce; but doe promiſe alſo and proteſt, if God will, and if I liue; that this thankefull accepting hereof, ſhall ſtirre me vp, &amp; pricke me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to the publiſhing hereafter of other things, in like manner and methode, with more time, with better aduiſe, with exac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diligence, with ſounder iudgement, through the grace of God.</p>
            <p>God for his mercy ſake giue &amp; grant, that theſe my labours may bring that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite which I heartily deſire: that all glory thereby may redounde to God, and all profit ariſe to the brethren. And the God of all grace, euen the father of our Lorde
<pb facs="tcp:19545:6"/> Ieſus Chriſt, preſerue and keepe you, in pure religion, in perfect peace, in feruent loue, in vnfained faith, in acceptable righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, in reuerend feare, in true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, al the daies of this your mortal life; that this race and courſe of miſerable wretchedneſſe finiſhed, you may receiue the happie fruite of the glorious goſpell, with all the Saints: and be partaker of the vndefiled crowne of immortall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in the purchaſed kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am not ignorant (right deare and chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) how many men, ſound of iudgement, ripe in yeares, profounde in learning: haue written vpon euerie part and par cell of holy Scripture: Whoſe authoritie might terrifie, and feare me from adding any thing thereunto. Notwithſtanding, ſeeing what one man hath omitted, another may remember: and what one hath ſhortened, another may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large and amplifie: what one hath vttered ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurelie, another may ſpeake and write perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſlie: And in as much as the later may adde
<pb facs="tcp:19545:8"/> to the former, though otherwiſe moſt exellent. Theſe and the like conſiderations mouing mee thereunto, I haue aduentured, and vndertaken after ſo many, to write ſomething vpon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Saint Iames his canonicall Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>Wherein, if I can promiſe nothing els: yet this one thing may I aſſure thee, that thou haſt it now both more amplie, and alſo more orderly then by any heretofore: and that in ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode, as (to my knowledge) none hath labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, eitber in this, or other like places of the holy Scripture: hauing drawen firſt the generall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalyſis, or reſolution of the whole Epiſtle: then the particular of euery chapter, with the like prefixed before euerie Lecture or ſermon, in this expoſition. So that who ſo is but of ſimple capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, by the very tables, may ſee and ſearch out, the very meaning of the holy Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>And to the end that greater profite might redound to the ignorant; I haue affected no cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tearmes: I haue not hindered the courſe of my ſpeach by ſentences or ſayings in vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen languages: But I haue ſet downe all things in our natiue, naturall, and mother tongue, (ſome three or foure wordes onely excepted:) whether they be teſtimonies of holy Scriptures, or ſentences of heathen Phyloſophers, or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
<pb facs="tcp:19545:8"/> of learned Fathers, that in no wiſe the Reader might be interrupted.</p>
            <p>Take (gentle Reader) this my firſt trauell in good part, geue it the reading to the end, and I doubt not but thy labour ſhall reape &amp; receiue anſwearable profite. And if euery place doe not ſatisfie or content thee, (as all that are learned know doeth neuer come to paſſe alike) yet paſſe through, and there ſhalbe ſome thing found, (I truſt) to quit thy trauell. But as for ſuch as haue a kinde of felicitie and happines, in carping at other mens doings: whom nothing pleaſeth, but chickens of their owne hatching: I charge them before the Lord, and in the name of Ieſus Chriſt that they ſlanderouſly backbite me not, but bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly admoniſh me, if there ſhal herein appeare any thing diſpleaſant vnto them: that ſo the profit of the church, and the glory of God in all things may be ſought, and not mens perſons vn charitablic condemned.</p>
            <p>And in ſo curious reprouing, and ſharp cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring, as wherunto I know beforehand I ſhalbe ſubiect; this is my only comfort, that no man pleaſeth alparties, &amp; thoſe in al faculties, which haue been moſt excellent, haue by ſome been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo condemned. Seeking therefore the profite of many, I contemne the carping reproof of ſome:
<pb facs="tcp:19545:9"/> and applying my ſelfe to pleaſe the godlie, I am not much afraide of the cenſure of the wicked. Wherefore (Chriſtian Reader) I deſire thee to reade with patience, accept with fauour; and iudge with charitie: So ſhalt thou ſtirre and prick forwarde, not me alone, but other alſo, to vndertake greater matters for thy comfort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, and profite.</p>
            <p>Now gentle Reader, I heartely deſire thee, to beare with ſuch faults, as in the printing here of are committed: as with ſetting downe one place for another; one Epiſtle for another; with the pointing, and ſuch like: Wherein, albeit I haue laboured to my power, in deliuering all things according to trueth: yet ſome faultes are committed, which thou thy ſelfe ſhalt both eaſily eſpie, and readily amend by thy owne diligence. And as for matters of greater obſeruation, thou ſhalt finde them corrected by themſelues; the leafe, page, ſection, and line of the ſection being ſet downe: whereby, if any errour ſhal cauſe any doubt, thou maiſt in the noting the errata, be reſolued. Thus fare thou moſt hartely wel in the Lord.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the firſt chapter of S Iames there are two parts. The firſt is the title of the Epiſtle: the other is the handling of the places and doctrines therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The title being the firſt thing, according vnto the manner of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, containeth three thinges. 1. The perſon which writeth it. 2. The perſons to whom the Epiſtle is written. 3. The greeting or ſalutation he ſendeth them. In the perſon which writeth there are two things noted: 1. his name, Saint <hi>Iames.</hi> 2. his calling; the ſeruant of Chriſt. The perſons to whom he writeth, were the twelue tribes of Iſraell diſperſed: the greeting or ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; he wiſheth them to reioyce.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond part of this chapter is the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the places and doctrines therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<pb facs="tcp:19545:12"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And the places are foure. 1. is of bearing the croſſe and ſuffering outwarde affliction: wherein foure things may be noted: 1. the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the place; the ſaints muſt reioyce vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der manifold temptations: 2. the confirmation and the reaſons why they ſhould ſo doo: 1. from honeſtie and comelineſſe: 2. from profite and commoditie: 3. from the cauſe and ende why it ſhould be done: that we may be perfit: 3. a diſtinguiſhing of perſons, thereby ſhewing that afflictions are profitable to all: both poore and rich. 4. The concluſion, from the reward of our ſufferings. Wherein he ſheweth, 1. the greatnes of the reward: 2. the certainenes thereof: 3. the perſons thereof capable.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The next place handled is touching waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring prayers, which he intermingleth with the former place, whereof 2. 3. 4. 5. verſes: in 6. 7. 8. the Apoſtle by a digreſsion ſpeaketh of wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and wauering praiers: which he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth three waies: 1. from a ſimilitude or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, comparing them to the waues of the ſea, which are alwaies toſſed: 2. from their vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitablenes: they get and obtayne nothing at Gods hand: 3. from a generall ſentence: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he affirmeth that ſuch perſons are trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in their whole life, and in all their waies.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19545:12"/>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third place here handled is of inward temptations, proceeding from our owne corrupt concupiſcence: in which place S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſetteth downe four things: 1. the propoſition, wherin he diſchargeth God from being author of euill temptations: partly, becauſe the nature of God is ſuch, as he can neither tempt, nor be tempted to euil: partly, becauſe there are other true cauſes of ſuch like temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; euen our own luſtes &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence: partly from contrarie effects: God is authour of all good, therefore cannot be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of euil temptations: 2. the putting downe of the true cauſe of temptations, our own concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence: 3. What effects that worketh, after it conceaueth once, it bringeth foorth ſinne and death: 4. In this place the laſt thing is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, admoniſhing vs that we erre not, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commit ſo great ſinne, as to aſcribe vnto God our euill temptations.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth and laſt part here handled, is the excellencie of the word of God, whereby wee are regenerate and borne anewe: In which place may three things be noted: 1. the worde, what it is, and what it doeth: 2. the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of things which hinder the courſe and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie of this worde: loquacitie and ſpeaking, when we ſhould be ſilent: and anger when wee
<pb facs="tcp:19545:13"/> are reproued: 3 finallie, he ſetteth down exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to the regenerate. 1. That they ſhoulde peaceably heare the word: 2. that they ſhoulde not heare it onely, but doe it alſo: 3. that ſuch as will be religious, muſt moderate their to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues: 4. that the Saints embrace true religion, which conſiſteth in two things: 1. in charity towards the poore and needie: 2. in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, and true holines.</p>

According to which ſpeech Abraham calleth his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phue Lot, brother; and Iacob, Laban his vncle; Laban, Iacob his coſen, brother.

And who theſe his brethren were, a little after he noteth by the confeſſion of the people, who hearing his wonderfull wiſdome, and ſeeing the ſtrange myracles which hee wrought among the people, as amazed thereat, cryed out, Is not this the Carpenters ſonne? is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren Iames and Ioſes, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Iude? and are not his ſiſters with vs? Whence then hath he theſe things?

For which cauſe both the Greeks &amp; the Syrians geue him the name of an apoſtle, affirming that Iames the Apoſtle wrote this. Notwithſtanding there were in former times, and are now alſo ſome, whith doubt of the authoritie of this Epiſtle: Into which doubt they haue been brought by theſe reaſons ſpecially. Firſt, he calleth himſelfe a ſeruant of Chriſt, but not an Apoſtle: therefore ſay they, it appeareth that it was not Iames the Apoſtle. This reaſon is moſt weake, and by the like may be refuted. Saint Iohn in his firſt Epiſtle calleth himſelfe neither the ſeruant of Chriſt, neither an Apoſtle, ſhoulde wee therefore conclude, that Iohn was neither the ſeruant, nor the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19545:16"/> Apoſtle of Chriſt? Were not this abſurde? In the other two Epiſtles he calleth himſelfe Elder, but not Apoſtle: Therefore was he not an Apoſtle which wrote them? Saint Iude in his generall Epiſtle calleth himſelfe the ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſt, <note place="margin">Jude ver.</note> and brother of this Iames, ſhall we therefore inferre and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, becauſe he calleth not himſelfe an Apoſtle, therefore he was none? If a king in his title ſhould omitte the name of his kingdome, ſhould it therefore follow he is no king? If becauſe he calleth not himſelfe an Apoſtle, the reaſon ſhoulde followe therefore he were not an Apoſtle, then ſhould the like follow in the other two Apoſtles, which may not be.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon is, This Writer maketh not mention ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes of the merites of Chriſt, as other Apoſtles doe, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.</note> it ſeemeth he was not an Apoſtle. For all the Apoſtles were ſent to preach Chriſt, &amp; remiſſion of ſinnes by his death The anſwere hereunto is not hard. He maketh memorable mention of Chtiſt, and his profeſſion calling him our glorious <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.</note> Lord, whoſe faith and religion he counſelleth to be without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons. And for his parte, his endeuour was in this place, to root out ſecuritie and hypocriſie out of the heartes of men, who with a bare name of faith deceiued &amp; flattered them ſelues; againſt which fond perſwaſion, and vaine oſtentation of faith, the Apoſtle bending himſelfe, could not ſo often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the merits of Chriſt, as others did, who hauing to doe with others which profeſſed not Chriſt, altogether almoſt entreat of his death, merites, and redemption, as hauing more matter miniſtred to labour in doctrine, then S. Iames had, who againſt carnall profeſſors, and counterfetting hypocrites, frameth his ſtile, and ſpendeth his labour to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>A third reaſon moueth them hereof to doubt, This Author <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 3</note> cyteth (ſay they) the ſtory of Abraham to proue iuſtification by works, which S. Paul to the Romanes &amp; Galathians citeth for iuſtification by faith. Thus ſeemeth this Author to preach co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Paul, whoſe doctrine is plaine, that we are iuſtified by grace freely, without the workes of the lawe, euen by faith in Chriſt Ieſu. This may thus be repelled. Theſe Apoſtles ſpake not in the ſame ſence of faith and iuſtification, but S. Paul of true faith, S. Iames of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfet faith: S. Paul of iuſtification by faith before God, Saint Iames of being knowen to be iuſtified,

Paul with them which aſcribing too much to their works, de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rogated from faith in Ieſus Chriſt. Againſt whom Paul diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting proueth that iuſtification before God is by faith onely in Chriſt, vnto which purpoſe works auaile nothing. Saint Iames dealt with men quite contrary affected, euen ſuch as boaſting to much of their bare faith, neglected the ſtudy of good works, &amp; ſo ſlept in the cradle of ſecuritie: wherfore S. Iames, to rouſe and rayſe them, affirmeth that bare faith, neglecting and not regarding good works, is dead, and profiteth nothing, becauſe works are as teſtimonies and fruites of our faith, whereby it is knowen to be either dead or liuely, as the tree is manifeſt by the fruites thereof. Euen as Abraham being before God iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, yet by his works ſhewed his faith, wherby he was knowen to be righteous, and thereby ſo reputed of men, and therto ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth he faithfully the ſtory of Abraham, not to prooue that by his works he was iuſtified before god, but to ſhew that his faith was fruitful in all good works to the glory of God: and that by his works he was knowen to men to be righteous, and ſo the Scripture fulfilled, Abraham beleeued, and it was imputed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for righteouſnes. So that there is ſweet melody, and a ioyfull harmonie betwixt theſe Apoſtles, in that, that S. Iames in the ſecond chapter teacheth that, which almoſt in euery E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle Paul preached, that men muſt not profeſſe religion in word onely, as hypocrites do, but by good works beautify their calling, that their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be anſwerable &amp; correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to their profeſsion, &amp; ſo God in al things glorified, through Ieſus Chriſt. S. Iames then ſaw the peſtilent hypocriſie of men, who like the olde Philoſophers, could ſpeake welof vertue, but would not perform that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, which they gaue in precept <note place="margin">

               <p>There is another kinde of ſeruants, which are ſeruants by profeſſion &amp; calling, who offer their ſeruice vnto God, and his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, which are alſo of two ſorts. Men are the ſeruants of God, either generally, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particularly. Generally they are all the ſeruantes of Ieſus Chriſt, whoſoeuer profeſſe his religion, and promiſe their ſeruice vnto him in the generall calling of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Thus bond and free, male and female, young and olde, rich and poore, prince and people, wiſe and fooliſh, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ignorant, baſe borne and honourable, one and another: euen all ſuch as profeſſe the religion of God, and of Chriſt, are his ſeruants.

In this ſence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely is ſetuant taken in holy Scripture, meaning all ſuch as ſerue God in profeſſion of religion.</p>
               <p>Specially they are called the ſeruants of God, and of Chriſt, who in ſome ſeueral and chiefe calling do homage vnto God, and promote his kingdome. So Princes in com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon wealths, Preachers and Miniſters in the Church of Chriſt, are ſeruants of God and of Chriſt, in ſpeciall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Our ſauiour Chriſt in ſome ſence is alſo a ſeruant, in that in the office of a mediatour he ſerued the wil and pleaſure of his father, whereof the prophet Ezechiel ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <note place="margin">

Seruing therefore as the head, &amp; great Shepheard of the church, he is called in a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the ſeruant of God. Dauid and other Princes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God in the chiefe place of the common wealth, in handling the ſcepter of gouernment, are called Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. Magiſtrates ſeeking by ſetting foorth Gods glory and true religion, by geuing precepts, and making lawes for the aduancement of godlines and vertue, are called the ſeruants of God in that ſpeciall ſeruice, as Auguſtine <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 50.</note> to Boniface the Earle at large ſheweth. So the Apoſtles and Miniſters of Gods word, ſpecially called to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19545:18"/> of the word and ſacraments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are called in reſpect of that ſpeciall ſeruice, ſpecially the ſeruants of God and of Chriſt, as Saint Paul in ſundrie his Epiſtles, Saint Peter, and this Apoſtle of himſelfe ſpeaketh, calling themſelues the ſeruants of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Princes themſelues haue no greater honour then to <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iames</hi> 1.</note> become ſeruaunts vnto Chriſt, and to licke duſt vnder the feet of his Church, as the Prophet ſpeaketh: which is, that earthly Princes ſhould not feare to ſet out the goſpel, <note place="margin">

Yea this is by the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes 1. chap. verſe 7. attributed to the angels of God, as their hieſt honour to be miniſtring ſpirites to Chriſt, and to be ſubiect vnto him. How many times doeth Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Ioſua, Dauid, Ezechiah, and all the zealous kinges of Iuda entitle themſelues the ſeruants of God? How often doeth God ſhew foorth his great loue, fauour and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to Iſrael, yea and many other vnder this name, that they are his ſeruants? Who euer of the Princes of the earth, but Pharao, and Senacherib, and the like, exalted themſelues againſt him in this wiſe, Who is the Lorde that I ſhould heare his voice?

               <p>And this diſperſing and ſcattering of theſe tribes was not at once, and together, but at diuers times, and vpon ſundrie occaſions: partly they were diſperſed and ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red when Salmanaſer king of the Aſſirians caried them <note place="margin">4. <hi>Kings</hi> 17.</note> captiue into Aſſiria, and helde them in cruell bondage: partly when they were ſubdued by Nabuchodonoſor, and <note place="margin">4. <hi>Kings</hi> 24</note> caried into Babylon into captiuitie, for the rebellion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ehoiakim againſt the king of Babylon, to whom he was ſubiect: partly they were diſperſed by reaſon of the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and ſturre that was in Aſia and Aegypt: partly when immediately after the death of Saint Stephen, the cruell <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 8.</note> Phariſies moued perſecution againſt the Church at Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, inſomuch as thereby ſuch as beleeued, were ſcattered throughout the regions of Iudea and Samaria. The lewes being thus miſerablie diſperſed and ſcattered into euery coaſt and countrie, place and prouince of the worlde, ſo that in perſon, and by his preſence, hee coulde not teach them by liuely voice, and worde of mouth, the Apoſtle by his letters which might better be brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, informeth them in their duties, and thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto them diſperſed. Of which ſcattering there was manifeſt token, in that Saint Paul being the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, and ſent to preach vnto them, into what place ſo euer he came almoſt, he found a Sinagogue of the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>Gal.

               <p>And this diſperſing of the beleeuing Iewes among the Gentiles, putteth plaine difference betweene the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, and the kingdoms of this worlde. The kingdomes of this worlde be they neuer ſo ample, large, and great, yet are they contained within certaine bounds, circuits, and limits of the earth. The kingdome of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians and Medes, a mightie kingdome, hauing beſides Sidrach, Miſach, and Abednego, 120. princes and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, yet it was meaſured by it limits and bounds: it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched not through the whole worlde. The Grecians, the Romans, the Babylonians, and other people had mightie Monarches, Dominions, and Empires, yet none of them but had their bounds on earth, which they did not paſſe: but the kingdome of Chriſt is infinitely ſpread vpon the face of the earth, and runneth through the whole worlde: <note place="margin">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19545:21"/> and vniuerſally diffuſed and ſcattered vppon the whole earth, whereunto all the elect of God whereſoeuer diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, appertaine, as in the writing of Iames to the twelue tribes diſperſed, appeareth.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Beſides this, in that Saint Iames writeth vnto the twelue tribes diſperſed, it teacheth vs that the Church of Chriſt is tied or bound to no place. neither ſo faſtened to Hieruſalem, but it may be remoued: but is alwayes there where the true ſaints of god are. The church was ſomtime in paradiſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our prime parents were there reſident in their righteouſnes, but not ſo immoueably, but that it was afterward els where in Abell. The Church was in Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia in Abraham, but not there tied: but afterward it was here and there with him, now in Aegypt, now in Caldea, now in Canaan, now here, now there, with Iſaac, Iacob, and Ioſeph, with Dauid, the Princes, the Prophets, Chriſt, the holy Apoſtles, as the ſtories witneſſe. Now in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the Gentiles in the diſperſed Iewes, to whom S. Iames here writeth. Abſurdly therefore do our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Papiſts tie the Church of Chriſt to the Chaire of Peter in Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Seeing in all times it hath remoued with the faithfull, and is there where the worde is profeſſed, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments duly adminiſtred, diſcipline in ſome meaſure practiſed and exerciſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Now that Saint Iames mencioneth onely the twelue tribes of Iſrael, as the perſons to whom he writeth, we may not gather, that this doctrine appertaineth not to vs, nor to other Churches, as well as to the Iewes and ſcattered tribes, to whom it was chiefly and firſt ſent. For ſuch is the nature of God, that when he ſpeaketh to one man, or one people, yet then muſt all men, and all people heare him. Wherefore when he gaue his law to Iſrael onely, yet it concerneth all men, and condemneth all that are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 20</note> thereof. Saint Paul rehearſing the puniſhments which God inflicted vpon the Iewes for their horrible ſinnes, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10</note> ſhewing that the ſame appertaine vnto all, concludeth, that ſuch things came vpon them for examples, but were written to admoniſh vs, vpon whom the endes of the world are come. And generally ſpeaking of the whole
<pb facs="tcp:19545:22"/> ſcripture, that it is not written to any one people, but that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.</note> it concerneth others in like maner, ſaith: Whatſoeuer things are written aforetime, are written for our learning, that we through patience and conſolation of the holie ſcripture might haue hope. Whatſoeuer then in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, tendeth either to doctrine, or to inſtruction, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, correction, or conſolation, it after ſome maner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo pertaineth vnto all. Whether then the Saints write to whole Congregations and Churches, as Paul to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Corinthians, Galathians, Epheſians, Philippians, Colloſſians, Theſſalonians, and other Churches, or els to ſpeciall perſons, as Paul to Timothie, Titus, Philemon: Iohn to the elect Ladie: &amp; to Gaius beloued in the Lord: or other perſons, they in ſome maner concerne all men: and ſomething therhence may be gathered which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not thoſe places and perſons only, but all in generall, Though therefore Saint Peter write, to the Saints being <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1.</note> ſtraungers, which dwelt here and there throughout Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia, and Bithinia: and S. Iames here ſendeth this Epiſtle to the twelue tribes of Iſrael diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed and ſcattered: yet may we not thinke that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth them onely, but all men alſo, albeit for the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of time, place and perſon, they wrote vnto certaine.</p>
               <p>Neither is this marueilous or ſtrange. The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and prophane writers, as Plato, Cicero, Ariſtotle, Xenophon, Seneca, and others, haue written to ſeuerall and certaine perſons chiefly, yet their precepts concerned all the Gentiles, who thought themſelues bounde to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them. Shall humane Philoſophie dedicated to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perſons, binde all to obey it: and ſhall not the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly and diuine Philoſophie of Gods worde, though it thiefly be ſent to ſome one, yet bind all men to obedience? This Epiſtle was ſent to the twelue tribes diſperſed, yet it concerneth all men: Wherefore of the Grecians it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Catholike: of the Latins, Canonicall: of vs &amp; others, Generall, becauſe it concerneth all people in generall. Neither doth it follow, it was writ firſt to the Iewes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it appertaineth not to vs Gentiles: for the whole
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19545:22"/> law of God, and the whole doctrine of the Goſpell, was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.</note> firſt deliuered vnto the Iewes, and then afterwarde vnto the Gentiles. Thus much is neceſſarie herehence to know for vs, Who eaſily will turne the Iewes vnto obedience to the ſcriptures, and liue as we luſt our ſelues: as if theſe things concerned not vs, but them onely. The perſons to whom this Epiſtle was written, were the 12. tribes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed. and after them, the doctrine bindeth vs all to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedience.</p>
               <p>In the title the third and laſt thing is the greeting he <note place="margin">3. <hi>Salutation.</hi>

Touching greetings &amp; ſalutations, which amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g all men haue at all times been vſuall, wee need not curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to conſider, ſeeing it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be denied, but that both godly and profane perſons haue vſed it, and both profane writings, and the holy Scripture alſo deliuer and ſet down ſundry formes thereof. Plato diſputeth of the ſalutations and gteetings of the Gretians, whoſe common ſalutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s <note place="margin">3. <hi>Epiſt. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſio.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 The firſt herein is the propoſition of the place, which is, That the Saintes of God muſt beare afflictions: Vnder the heauy burthen whereof they may not faint, fall downe, nor quaile, but be patient, triumphe, and reioyce. Hereof he carefully admoniſheth, becauſe in their ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and diſperſing their condition could not be but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable: and therefore in theſe externall afflictions, they had neede to bee comforted, which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> doeth faithfully in this place; My brethren, count it exceeding ioy when ye fall into diuers temptations. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19545:24"/> like caſe writing to thoſe ſtrangers which were in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.</note> ſcattered here and there, in Pontus, Galatia, Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia, Aſia, and Bithinia, exhorteth them to beare afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without fainting. Dearely beloued, thinke it not ſtrange concerning the fiery triall which is among you, to proue you, as though ſome ſtrange thing were come vnto you, but reioyce, in as much as you are partakers of the ſufferings of Chriſt, that when his glory ſhall appeare, yee may be glad, and reioyce. Our Sauiour Chriſt foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Diſciples the condition wherunto they ſhould be <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 10</note> ſubiect, euen to bee as ſheepe among wolues: and for his ſake and the Goſpels to be brought before Iudges, ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Sinagogues, expelled and excommunicated their aſſemblies, and euery where euill entreated, and ſpitefullie handled: by his owne example exhorteth he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beare all theſe things, and willeth them with inuincible courage <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.</note> and patience, to take vp their croſſe and follow him. And elſwhere forewarning them of their oppreſſions, therin he willeth them to be of good cheare, and beare their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with patience. In the world (ſaith he) you ſhall haue trouble, but bee of good cheare, I haue ouercome the world. The holy Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to like purpoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.</note> men not to faint in heart, not to caſt downe their heads as diſcomfited, but in the midſt of their afflictions and miſeries to reioyce: Reioyce in hope, be patient in tribulation, continue in prayer. Which condition inſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ioyned with the profeſſion of the faith, ought not to ſeeme ſtrange vnto the Saints, neither to moue them. Which S. <hi>Paul</hi> conſidering, councelleth them to ſtand faſt <note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.</note> in the faith, and not to be moued with theſe afflictions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were thereunto appointed of God. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition therefore of this place is, that the Saints of God muſt arme themſelues againſt all manner afflictions, and therein reioyce exceedingly: Come there life, or come there death; come proſperitie, or come miſerable aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; come there ſicknes, or come there health; come there wealth, or come there woe; come there perſecution, or come there peſtilence; come there ſworde, or come there
<pb facs="tcp:19545:25"/> famine; come there captiuitie, or come there any other miſerie, we muſt be prepared and armed thereunto, and hold faſt the propoſition of the Apoſtle, Brethren, count it exceeding ioy when you ſhall fall into diuers tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>In this propoſition many thinges may bee obſerued worthy our conſideration. 1 That the Saints muſt cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it great ioy when they fall into temptations, and do ſuffer afflictions in the world. Wherin the ioyes of Gods ſaints, and the ioyes of the wicked are diſtinguiſhed. The wicked reioyce, ſome in one vaine thing of this world, ſome in an other: accounting ſicknes, pouertie, impriſonment, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie, miſerie, perſecution, famine, nakednes, ſword, death and ſuch like afflictions, as euils, wherefore they ſhunne them by all meanes, they abhorre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as infallible tokens of the heauie wrath of God, &amp; his iuſt hatred againſt them which ſuffer them, as appeared by the ſentence of <hi>Eliphas</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 4.</note> againſt holy <hi>Iob,</hi> who condemned him for wicked, becauſe he was afflicted: and by the cenſure of the wicked, who <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai</hi> 53.</note> iudged Chriſt as reiected of God, becauſe he was plagued and ſmitten by him. And the Iewes in like maner ſo iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of them vpon whom the tower of Silo fell, and whoſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 13,</note> bloud <hi>Pilate</hi> mingled with their ſacrifice, ſlaying them when they were offering: eſteeming them for wicked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their puniſhment. Finally, by the ſentence of the Barbarians in Melita, who ſeeing a Viper ſpringing out of the fire, to reſt vpon the hand of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 28.</note> accounted him for a murtherer, and a wicked perſon. But ſo doe not the Saints, for they know that theſe afflictions by the bleſſing and grace of God, tende to their furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſaluation in Ieſus Chriſt. Wherefore they therein reioyce exceedingly, and preferre this ioy before all worldly ioy whatſoeuer. Inſomuch as in the midſt of their miſerie, and in their tortures &amp; torments they haue triumphed: as, the holy Apoſtles being afflicted, beaten, and ſmitten for the teſtimonie of Gods trueth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> departed. and went out of the councell reioyſing, of whom S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi>

               <p>The holy and bleſſed martyrs haue in like maner counted it exceeding ioy, when they fel into temptations, wherin they being by the will of God, aboue the ſtrength and courſe of nature, haue triumphed: whereas then the wicked ſhunne theſe as ſimply euill, the ſaintes embrace them as teſtimonies of loue: whereas the wicked in their miſeries, frette; fume, and fome at mouth for rage and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſtampe, ſtare, murmure, and mutter againſt God, yea and blaſpheme him in extreeme deſperation, as Saint <note place="margin">

Whereas the wicked herein faint and fall into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, and reioice in other thinges onely: the Saints and holy men of God, make affliction the greateſt matter of their mirth, and to ſuffer for Chriſt and his Goſpel, their ſoundeſt ioy, remembring the propoſition of the Apoſtle here ſet downe: Brethren count it exceeding ioy when you fall into ſundrie temptations. Let worldlings then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in their riches, and glorie in their wealth, let them reioyce in their pleaſures, and delight themſelues in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and honour: let them make their bankets, bellie cheare, and riotouſneſſe their ioy: let them counte for their greateſt happineſſe and felicitie, worldly ſecuritie, and vacation from all trouble: yet this is the ioy, the mirth, the delight, the pleaſure, the felicitie and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the the Saints, wrongfully to ſuffer affliction, and
<pb facs="tcp:19545:26"/> this they count vpon earth their exceeding ioy, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they haue their reioycing. Let the wicked in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.</note> grow from worſe to worſe, as Pharao by his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons waxed worſer, and more impacient: let them vſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 31.</note> hands vpon themſelues, as <hi>Saul</hi> in daunger of the vncircumciſed Philiſtines, fell vpon his owne ſword, and periſhed: and many other at the loſſe of their riches, the ſpoile of their goodes, the departure of their friends, and other afflictions, murmured againſt God: yet the Saintes holde vp their heads, relie vpon God, humbling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues before him vnder the croſſe, and count it exceeding ioy when they fall into manifold temptations.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The worde, Fall into, is not without ſignification: whereby the Saints of God are taught that they may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther procure, neither haſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne croſſe, nor deſerue at the hands of the worlde thus to be afflicted. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts which in manie places, and at ſundrie times lay hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie croſſes vppon themſelues: as beating their owne fleſh, ſcourging their owne bodies, wearying and waſting themſelues with long, tedious, and troubleſome pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, fall not by the will of God hereinto, but by their owne choiſe, therefore haue no cauſe therein to reioice: theeues, robbers, pirates, murtherers, man quellers, euill doers, buſie bodies, who by their own deſert procure their owne miſerie, ought not therein to reioyce. Let no man, ſaith Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> ſuffer as a theefe, murtherer, euill doer, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 4.</note> or as a buſie bodie in other mens matters: but if any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed, but let him glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in that behalfe. When men are cauſes of their owne croſſes, and procure by their wickedneſſe their own puniſhments and afflictions, they muſt not therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, but rather lament and be ſorie: but when we fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to temptations by the will of God, then muſt we count it exceeding ioy. Fooliſh men puniſhed for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, malefactors chaſtined for their vngodlineſſe: wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ones afflicted for their vngraciouſneſſe, haue cauſe of ſorow, not of ioy: of mourning, not of mirth: of lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, not of laughter, in that they fall not hereinto by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19545:26"/> Gods will, but by their owne wickedneſſe: though ſecretly they doe that which from euerlaſting God hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Vnder the worde, Falling into, is inſinuated vnto men, vnder what affliction and croſſe they muſt reioyce: vnder that croſſe which God impoſeth and layeth vpon vs: vnder thoſe afflictions whereinto wee fall by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and purpoſe of God to trie vs: therein when we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, we muſt count it exceeding ioy.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The circumſtance of time may not be lightly paſſed ouer: My brethren, count it exceeding ioy when you fall, that is, whenſoeuer you fall into temptations. This tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the children of God, that once or twiſe to reioyce vnder the croſſe, is not inough to the perfect dutie of a Chriſtian, but whenſoeuer, as often ſoeuer, at what time ſoeuer we are aſſaulted and aſſailed with temptations: ſo often to ſhew our ſelues pacient therein and ioyous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</note> our crowne is onely giuen in the ende of all our combats, which the authour to the Hebrues recounting, teacheth vs that we haue alwaies neede of pacience, that in fine and at length wee may obtaine the promiſe.

Bee thou conſtant vnto death, and I will giue vnto thee the crowne of life: It is not inough to begin to runne in the race of pacience, but wee muſt runne out our race with pacience, if we will be crowned. Therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth, that we runne on with pacience the race that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</note> is ſet before vs. Wherefore as he that hath borne the brunt of many bickerings, and hath quit himſelfe valiantly and like a man in ſundrie aſſaults and skirmiſhes: If before the ende of the battell he faint and giue ouer, loſeth all his former labor: and as he that plaieth on a ſtage, though he behaue himſelfe excellently in ſundry acts: yet if in the laſt act he quaile, he beareth away neither prime nor price in that action: and as hee that runneth a long time, but falleth or ſitteth downe before he come to the goale, hath not the crowne or garland: ſo if men in manie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, in ſundrie temptations, in diuers afflictions, haue
<pb facs="tcp:19545:27"/> reioyced: vnleſſe whenſoeuer they fall thereunto they ſtill reioice, they looſe their praiſe and commendation of pacience, whereof the Apoſtle to foretell and foreteach vs, would haue vs count it exceedtng ioy, whenſoeuer wee fall into temptations.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Finally, hee would men to count it exceeding ioy, when they fall into diuers or manifolde temptations. Wherein we muſt learne, that the afflictions of the ſaints are manifolde, diuers and ſundrie, and that ſpecially in three reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Theſe afflictions are manifolde in reſpect of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which God vſeth in inflicting them vpon the Saints. For ſome times hee vſeth the Diuel, ſometimes the meanes of men, ſome times other his creatures as inſtruments and meanes by afflictions to tempt the Saints. Hee vſed Satan in the temptation of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi>

                  <hi>Job,</hi> to whom he gaue licence in his goodes, and in his bodie to afflict him. Men, almightie God vſed to afflict Iſrael his people, wherefore in the Prophets the Aſſiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Babilonians, the Philiſtines, and Aegyptians, with other, are both plainly called, and manifeſtly diſcribed as the inſtuments of God to afflict his people. In which ſenſe Aſſur is called the rodde of the Lords furie, and the ſtaffe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſai.</hi> 10. <hi>Iere.</hi> 27. <hi>Ezec.</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26</note> of his wrath and indignation. Thus the Lord calleth Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchodonoſor, that cruell tyrant and ſhamefull idolater, his ſeruant, becauſe he vſed him as a meane to afflict his people. Thus vſed alſo God the Caldeans and Sabians as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.</note> his inſtruments to afflict <hi>Job</hi> the Patriarch and ſeruant of God. Thus he vſed Sennecharib to afflict <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> the Scribes and Phariſees to afflict our Sauiour, and to vſe all meanes of perſecution againſt the Apoſtles and diſciples. Thus he vſeth men to rob, ſpoile, ſlaie, murther, and euerie way to afflict his ſaints and ſeruants.</p>
               <p>God vſeth in like maner other creatures in afflicting of his Saints. Sometimes the heauens giue abundance of raine, whereby the corne and graine of the earth is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied, and the Saints and others brought to extremitie: ſome times the aire is infected, wherehence, ſickneſſe, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19545:27"/> &amp; peſtilence groweth, and the people are deſtroied. Some times brute beaſts riſe vp againſt men, and deſtroy them, as the Lion did the Prophet. The Lions which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied <note place="margin">3. <hi>Kings</hi> 13.</note> thoſe whom Salmanaſer ſent to inhabite Samaria, whereof that none were good were hard to affirme. By in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <note place="margin">4. <hi>Kings</hi> 17.</note> other his creatures, the ſaints themſelues are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afflicted: wherefore if we reſpect but the diuerſitie of inſtruments which almightie God vſeth in theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall afflictions, we ſhal eaſily be forced to confeſſe that in that regard euen our afflictions and temptations are ſundrie.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As in reſpect of the diuers inſtruments thereunto by God vſed, the temptations of men are diuers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold, ſo if we looke into the nature of temptations, they <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.</note> are no leſſe manifold and diuers. Hereunto the holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet hauing regard crieth out: Manie are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord deliuereth out of all. As many in number, ſo diuers in nature are our afflictions. Some are afflicted by exile and baniſhment: ſome by captiuitie and impriſonment: ſome by famin and nakedneſſe: ſome by perill and perſecution: ſome by ſlaunder and reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full contumelie: ſome by rackings and tearings in peeces: ſome by ſlaughter and ſworde: ſome by fire and fagots: ſome by ſores of bodie and ſundrie diſeaſes: ſome ſuffer in themſelues: ſome are afflicted in their friends, in their wiues in their children: ſome in their goods: ſome in their bodies: ſome in their credits: ſome by ſea: ſome by land: ſome at home: ſome abroade: ſome by open enemies: ſome by counterfeit friends: ſome by cruell oppreſſion: ſome by manifeſt iniuries: ſome by force: ſome by fraud: ſome afflicted and tempted by one meanes, ſome by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and ſo manie kinds of temptations there be that the Apoſtle may worthily call them manifolde and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Finally, the ends wherfore they are infflicted are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, therefore in that reſpect alſo they may not amiſſe be counted diuers. Some times we are afflicted to the ende we ſhould be humbled: ſome times we are afflicted to the
<pb facs="tcp:19545:28"/> ende we ſhould be tried: ſome times we are afflicted, that in the nature of Gods bleſſings we may better be inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: ſome times we are afflicted, that God may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: ſome times we are afflicted, that our ſinnes thereby may be remitted: ſometimes we are afflicted, that the pride of our hearts may be repreſſed, and ſinfull deſires mortified: ſome times we are afflicted, that his loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs may the more liuely be expreſſed: ſome times we are afflicted, that thereby the world may be hated of vs: ſometimes we are afflicted, that we may be more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in praier for deliuerance: ſome times we are afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that we in afflictions made conformable and like the image of the ſonne of God, togither with him, may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> of his glorie. As therefore euery thing ſerueth not for one purpoſe, neither is euery medicine ordained for euery maladie: ſo neither hath euery temptation one end wherefore it is inflicted, but many ends there are of many afflictions: ſo that in reſpect of their ſundrie ends, they are alſo diuers &amp; manifold: partly then in reſpect of the manifold inſtruments whereby God afflicteth men: partly in reſpect of the ſundrie kinds of temptations: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reſpect of the manifold ends which in afflictions god reſpecteth, they may well be called and tearmed diuers and manifold. And theſe are the things in this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the firſt branch of the diuiſion to be obſerued: Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren count it exceeding ioy when you fall into diuers temptations.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The propoſition ended, the confirmation which is <note place="margin">2. <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </note> the ſecond thing here followeth, which containeth the reaſons and arguments which the Apoſtle vſeth, whie the Saints ſhould be comforted vnder the croſſe, and count it exceeding ioy when they fall into diuers tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, The reaſons are three.</p>
               <p n="1">1 From honeſt comelines in the Saints. It is comely &amp; honeſt, and a thing dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the Saints paciently to haue their faith tried: by afflictions of this life, the faith of Gods Saints and ſeruants is tried: the Saints therefore in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions muſt reioyce and be pacient. No man doubteth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19545:28"/> but it is a comely and honeſt thing for Gods children pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to ſuffer the triall of their ſaith. And that afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons make manifeſt triall and proofe of our faith, the holy <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gene.</hi> 22.</note> Scriptures of God aboundantly teach vs. When Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God would haue the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſhine and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare glorious vnto the world, he tempted him by wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to ſacrifice his onely ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in whom only vvas the hope of all the promiſes.

Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.</note> the Saints, that they were vnder manifold temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the triall of their faith, being much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then golde that periſheth, though it be tried in the fire, might be found to their praiſe, honour and glorie, at the comming of Ieſus Chriſt. And thus ſeeing the ende to be the triall of the faith of the Saints, he calleth affliction <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.</note> the fierie triall. Thinke it not ſtrange, dearly beloued, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fierie triall which is among you. Wherein ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an eie to the compariſon ſo vſuall in ſcripture, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Saints are compared to gold and ſiluer, who are tried by affliction, as theſe mettels are by fire, calleth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
<pb facs="tcp:19545:29"/> fierie triall. The Angell willed <hi>Iohn</hi> to write to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.</note> the Church of Smyrna, to exhort them not to feare any of the things which the diuell ſhould lay vpon them, to trie them: whereby it is more cleare then the Sunne in his brightneſſe at noone day. That afflictions are for the triall of the faith of men, they are as the touch-ſtone to trie gold from copper, as the fornace to diſcerne ſiluer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> droſſe, as the ſieue or fan to ſift the chaffe from the wheat. Wherefore as that is counterfet, not true gold which bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and abideth not the touch-ſtone, that droſſe and dregges which carieth not the fining: that duſt and chaffe which ſuffereth not the ſifting: ſo that faith which will not abide trial by affliction, is weake, imperfect, wauering, and vnſeemely in any Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Whereas then ciuill and morall vertues are then ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt tried when their obiect is preſent, whereon they may worke, as fortitude in daunger: chaſtitie in pleaſure: tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in preſent dainties and delicates: anger when we are prouoked: ſo the faith of Gods children is then moſt manifeſt, when affliction are preſent to trie them. And as the ſtarres and moone ſhine not at noone day, when the Sunne ſhineth in his glorious beautie: ſo neither doe the vertues of Chriſtians then appeare, when men are in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, but in the night and miſt of affliction. Seeing then it is a comely and honeſt thing in the Saints of God to haue proofe and triall of their faith, and other vertues, to bee made: and this triall is made ſpecially by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and troubles of this life: then no doubt ought the Saints paciently to ſuffer affliction, and to count it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ioy when they fall into diuers temptations, in as much as the triall of their faith bringeth foorth their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vertues: and afflictions are therefore ſent to make trial of the faith of Gods children, and this is the firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or argument of the confirmation, lying ſecretly in the word triall.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Another reaſon ſet downe manifeſtly, is drawen from the vtilitie and profite which commeth by bearing afflictions: by bearing paciently the miſeries and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19545:29"/> of this life, the moſt ſingular vertue of patience is wrought in vs. If affliction and triall of our faith bring vnto vs the worthie vertue of patience, who would not then count it exceeding ioy when they fall into diuers temptations?</p>
               <p>Troubles in the wicked, are cauſes, or rather occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in them to fret and fume; to grudge and groane; mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and murmure againſt God; But in Gods Saintes they are the inſtruments whereby God worketh patience in their hearts, therefore to be reioyced in, count it therefore my brethren, exceeding ioy whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you fal into temptations, becauſe the triall of your faith bringeth foorth patience. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be obiected, that this place and doctrine is againſt Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who entreating of the like argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſaith contrary to this. For Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, That the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or proofe of our faith bringeth forth patience: But S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That patience bringeth foorth triall or proofe. Theſe are contrary and how can they then hang togither?</p>
               <p>The reconciliation of theſe places may be this. 1 The words by <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> vſed, are not the ſame, therefore neither is the thing the ſame: Speaking then of diuers <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </note> things, they ſpeake not contrarily one to the other. In this place proofe is taken actiuely, as it ſignifieth thoſe things whereby we are tried, as afflictions themſelues, whereby occaſion is miniſtred of trying and proouing the faithfull. Thus temptations and afflictions trie vs, and this triall or proofe, (that is, the things whereby wee are tried and prooued, which are afflictions) bringeth foorth patience. that is, miniſtreth matter of our patience. And thus triall with <hi>James</hi> here, is as cauſe of that triall with <hi>Paul,</hi> which after this manner is as an effect. With <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </note> triall is taken paſſiuely, as, it ſignifieth that proofe and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all which is made of vs, by which wee are made knowen. This knowledge commeth through our patience: for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience maketh vs to be knowen whether we mutter and murmure, or whether we be quiet in our ſufferings. And thus patience cauſeth &amp; bringeth foorth that experience, proofe or triall, which is made of vs. And thus is patience
<pb facs="tcp:19545:30"/> cauſe (as it were) of triall.</p>
               <p n="2">2 We may not looke ſo ſtraitly and narrowly into cauſes and effects, but that we may graunt the ſame to be cauſe and effect alſo in ſundrie kindes of cauſes, or in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reſpects. For triall, proofe, experience of moſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſucceſſe, and happie iſſue in many troubles, encrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeth our patience, and confirmeth our conſtancie: ſo that the more triall we haue of good ſucceſſe, the more pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and more conſtant are we made in affliction: and thus triall cauſeth parience as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith. On the other ſide, patience, and ſuffering of the croſſe, cauſeth great experience, and proofe of Gods preſence to deliuer vs, &amp; alſo maketh vs knowen of what behauiour wee be in our troubles. And thus patience cauſeth triall, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> faith: and ſo triall and patience are mutuall helpers, and nouriſhers one to another, and both cauſe and effect one of the other. Thus S. <hi>James</hi> ſaying that triall of our faith bringeth foorth patience; and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that patience bringeth foorth triall or proofe, ſpeaketh trueth alſo. For the triall of our faith maketh perfect our patience, that the more we are tried, the more patient we are. And pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience cauſeth triall, becauſe he whoſe faith faileth not, &amp; whoſe patience is inuincible, is thereby prooued and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to be of excellent conſtancie.</p>
               <p>Theſe thinges thus premiſed and ſet downe before, the meaning of the Apoſtle is not doubtfull. The triall of your faith bringeth forth patience, that is, the afflictions and temptations themſelues (whereby your faith is tried) bringeth foorth patience. And this is one and the ſame which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preacheth to the Romans, We reioyce in tribulation, knowing that tribulation bringeth foorth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</note> patience. Our trials and tribulations, our afflictions and miſeries which here wee ſuffer, inure and accuſtome vs to the croſſe; and men accuſtomed to a thing, grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be patient. What we are dayly vſed vnto, that we fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally beare quietly: dayly afflictions make vs ſo accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and acquainted with ſufferings, that thereby we grow to be patient. Wherefore, as <hi>Milo Crotoniales</hi> by bearing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19545:30"/> a calf when it was yong, was made able by dayly exerciſe, to beare it alſo when it was an olde oxe: So men by daily bearing the croſſe, ſhalbe enhabled to beare it patiently. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.</note> Therfore the prophet ſaid wiſely, that it was good to beare the croſſe from a child, that as the affliction groweth grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, ſo our patience might grow greater alſo: and ſo affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the triall of our faith make vs patient. Thus afflictions and the triall of our faith thereby, bring foorth patience, not as the efficient cauſe of patience, and the geuer of patience, which is God onely; Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Philip.</hi>
                  </note> ſaith to the Philippians, that it was geuen to them both to beleeue in Chriſt, and alſo to ſuffer for him. But as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall cauſe, as the occaſion miniſtred, whereon our patience may worke. Seeing therefore afflictions do thus bring foorth patience, ſo excelient a vertue, as whereby <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</note> we poſſeſſe our ſoules, and obteine the promiſes, as both our Sauiour witneſſeth, and the Apoſtle proteſteth, this is reaſon inough to moue vs in afflictions to reioyce. And this is the ſecond reaſon why the Saintes ſhould count it exceeding ioy when they fall into diuers temptations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the triall of their faith bringeth foorth patience.</p>
               <p n="3">3 From euent or effect the Apoſtle finally reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. The Saints muſt count it exceeding ioy when they fall into temptations, becauſe patience in affliction, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men entire and perfect. Affliction, and the croſſe of Chriſt are the inſtruments whereby God doth polliſh vs, and refine vs, till we grow to be perfect in Chriſt, and become like and conformable vnto the ſonne of God him ſelfe, the perfect pattern of all patience. Seeing then by patience we be made perfect, and patience is cauſed and gendred of affliction, we therefore ought in affliction to reioyce.</p>
               <p>Here the word perfect ſignifieth ſtable, conſtant, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and perſeuering, continuing and enduring vnto the end, in the moſt holy profeſſion of the Goſpell, with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage inuinſible, as abſolute, entire, and lacking nothing, to this perfection we attaine by patience.</p>
               <p>Patience in affliction is the ſchoole and nurture-houſe
<pb facs="tcp:19545:31"/> of Chriſt and of the holy Ghoſt, and the effectuall meane which the Lord our God vſeth to make vs perfect: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if we be continually trayned, vve ſhall grow to full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and perfection of vertue. Thus <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> thus <hi>Joſeph</hi> and holy <hi>Job,</hi> mightie Patriarkes, thus <hi>Moiſes, Iſai, Jeremie,</hi> thus <hi>Michai</hi> and <hi>Zacharie,</hi> holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: thus <hi>Dauid, Hezechia,</hi> and the reſt of the zealous Princes: thus <hi>Paul, Peter, Iohn,</hi> and others, true Apoſtles: thus <hi>Steuen, Polycarpe,</hi> and infinite the like faithfull Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, haue by patience in afflictions growen to ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of perfection, as in the weakenes of nature, and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of man, may be attained vnto. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his <note place="margin">De bono patientiae.</note> booke entituled, Of the profit and good of patience, in a large diſcourſe ſheweth, that by patience we are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and preſented to God, that anger is repreſſed, the tongue refrayned, the minde gouerned, and man thereby on euery ſide perfect. True then is the Apoſtles ſaying, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouching that patience maketh vs perfect and entire, lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nothing.</p>
               <p>But now that the Apoſtle here ſaith, that by pacience we are made perfect, we may note that perfection is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. One perfection there is of the ſubſtance of thinges, as, he that beleeueth conſtantly vpon Chriſt without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering, is perfect in faith: for hee hath the perfection of the ſubſtance of faith. Who ſo holdeth the doctrine of Chriſt as the infallible word of trueth, and therunto clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth immoueably, as to the anchor of the ſoule, both ſure and ſtedfaſt, hee hath the word of God perfectly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſubſtance. Who ſo conſtantly continueth in the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.</note> profeſſion of his religion, that neither with blaſt of vayne perſwaſion, neither with ſtorme of cruel perſecution he be remoued, is perfect. Thus men in this world may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in vertues, when they haue the true ſubſtance of the vertues for which they are commended.</p>
               <p>There is another perfection, which is of degrees, which is ſuch as cannot be encreaſed in any degree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as, to haue ſuch faith, as that we need not to pray, Lord increaſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 17.</note> our faith: to haue ſuch knowledge, as wee neede not with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19545:31"/> 
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> deſire further to be enſtructed in the wayes of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal</hi> 25. 119. 86.</note> Lord, to haue ſuch patience, as that cannot be augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſuch perfection, as in nothing canbe encreaſed; thus no man is perfect in this infirmitie and weaknes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: by patience we grow to perfection of the ſubſtance of ſundrie vertues, but not to perfection in degrees: but to ſuch a meaſure as of men in this life may be attayned, whereunto the name of perfection is geuen. Thus both men in holy Scripture, and things are ſometimes called perfect, as <hi>Iob, Zacharie,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and others: yet not abſolutely, but either in compariſon of the wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>godly, then whom the Saints are more holy, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon perfect: either becauſe the Saintes excell in the greater part of their life in excellent vertues, as S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> auoucheth, and another father to like purpoſe, Men <note place="margin">2. <hi>De meritis &amp; remiſ. c.</hi> 2.</note> are called perfect, not that there is no imperfection in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but becauſe they are commended with a great heape of vertues: Or finally, becauſe that meaſure whereunto wee grow, and thoſe vertues whereunto we aſpire and clime, are reputed in the Saints for perfect, by the imputation of the perfection of Ieſus Chriſt, whereby all the vertues of the Saints are accepted with God.</p>
               <p>Seeing then by patience vnder the manifold afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this life, we increaſe in vertue, and growe to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, perfect, and as lacking nothing, ſhall we not thereby be moued to holde faſt the exhortation and propoſition of the Apoſtle, Brethren, count it exceeding ioy whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you fall into diuers temptations, knowing that your triall of faith bringeth foorth patience, and let patience haue her perfect worke, that you may be perfect and entire, &amp; lacke nothing? And theſe are the three reaſons wherefore wee ought to count it exceeding ioy when we fall into diuers temptations.</p>
               <p>Theſe things thus ſet down, the Saints might haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected <note place="margin">3. <hi>A preoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</hi>
                  </note> againſt his doctrin, It were good thus to do we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not; but it is not ſo ſoon done as eaſilie ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as thogh we were able of our ſelues thus in our afflictions to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our ſelues, that whenſoeuer we be afflicted, to accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:19545:32"/> it exceeding ioy. This obiection the Apoſtle anſwereth, I know this is not a qualitie in the power and ſtrength of nature, but it is a ſpeciall grace and gift of God, in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to comfort our ſelues, that we be not caſt downe, nor faint hearted, but rather be glad and reioyce. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to be asked of him which onely geueth this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly wiſdome. In which place there may two things be obſerued. 1. The obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which might haue been made. 2. Then the anſwere thereunto.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The obiection is, Wee cannot of our ſelues thus beare the croſſe, we haue no ſuch ſtrength in nature, there is nothing more vnpleaſant or vnſauourie to the fleſh, then is the croſſe. We know that in vs, that is, in our fleſh, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</note> dwelleth no good thing: of our ſelues, as of our ſelues wee cannot ſo much as thinke a good thought. How vnequall <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> are we then to the bearing of ſo heauie a burthen? Wee muſt needes ſinke vnder the croſſe, wherefore in vaine, O holy and bleſſed apoſtle, in vain aſſuredly is this doctrine preached vnto vs.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The anſwere hereunto is this, I know that this is a hard doctrine to the fleſh: I confeſſe wee are vnable of our ſelues to performe it: this is the ſpeciall grace &amp; gifte of God, to account our afflictions exceeding ioy vnto vs. Therefore is it not to be hoped for in our ſelues, but from him to be praied for: wherfore if any man lack wiſdome, let him aske it of God, which geueth to all men liberally, and reproacheth none, and it ſhalbe geuen him, but let him aske it in faith and wauer not. In which anſwer foure things are to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1 What this wiſdome is. It is the doctrine of the croſſe here ſpecified, namely, to endure patiently whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer God layeth vpon vs, and to know that God in ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar loue correcteth all thoſe with the rodde of affliction, whom he purpoſeth to make heires of his eternall glory. This to knowe is wiſdome farre greater then the wiſdome of men.</p>
               <p>This wiſdome ſtandeth in two things. 1. In know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that we wiſely vnderſtand the cauſes for which we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19545:32"/> are thus afflicted of God, as that partly for the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our ſinnes, as the princely Prophet recordeth, For ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie <note place="margin">Pſal.</note> haſt thou chaſtened man; partly for the more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation and plainer triall of our faith, as <hi>Abraham, Iob, Iſrael</hi> the ſeruant and people of God; partly for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement of Gods greater glory, that thereby in the deliuerance of men from their calamities, hee might be more glorified. Finally, that hereby wee being touched, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> might repent, leſt that wee periſh with the worlde. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to haue true vnderſtanding and knowledge, is a great point of wiſdome, euen of this wiſdome whereof the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>As the wiſdome how to beare the croſſe, conſiſteth in knowledge and vnderſtanding of the ends wherefore it is inflicted and laide vpon vs: ſo alſo it conſiſteth in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward feeling and iudgement, when in our heartes, ſoules and conſciences, we haue ſenſe and feeling of the comfort of the ſpirite, which in afflictions of this life, and in the croſſe wherunto we are ſubiect, vpholdeth and ſupporteth vs, and with aſſured hope of ſafe deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in due ſeaſon, vnderproppeth vs,</p>
               <p>This point of wiſdome to feele inwardly the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the ſpirite, was in holy <hi>Iob,</hi> who therefore in the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 19.</note> midſt of all his miſeries, and in the greateſt brunt of his afflictions, in liuely hope, in aſſured faith, in wonderfull confidence, in inward feeling of rare comfort of the holy Ghoſt, breaketh out and ſaith, I know that my redeemer liueth, and that I ſhall riſe againe in the latter day, &amp; ſhall ſee God in my fleſh, and not with other, but with theſe ſame eyes. This point of wiſdome had <hi>Dauid</hi> learned, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.</note> in great confidence and truſte, and ſingular conſolation of the ſpirite, he brake out and cried; Though I ſhoulde walke through the ſhadow of death yet will I feare no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: for thou Lord art with me, thy rod and thy ſtaffe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte me. This wiſeome was in the Prophets, Apoſtles, holy Martyrs, whereby their torments and ſufferings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in themſelues extreame, yet became to them tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. To know therefore the ende and vſe of the croſſe
<pb facs="tcp:19545:33"/> and outward afflictions, to feele the preſence of the ſpirit of God in midſt of our miſeries comforting vs, whereby the burthen of the croſſe is lightened. This is ſurely the wiſdome mentioned by the Apoſtle, If any man lack wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This wiſdome is not a qualitie in nature, but grace, &amp; an excellent grace and gift of God, therefore of him onely is this wiſdome to be ſought, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to intimate, willeth that if any man lack this wiſdome, he ſhould aske it of God, to beare the croſſe patiently, to know the vſe of affliction truely, to feele the comfort of the ſpirite inwardly, this is wiſdome not of man, but of God; not of our ſelues, but from his heauenly goodneſſe; from whom all wiſdome floweth, as from a fountain: true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore <hi>Salomon,</hi> The Lord geueth wiſdome, out of his mouth commeth knowledge and vnderſtanding. And <note place="margin">

The holy and bleſſed Apoſtle therfore acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging this to bee the gift of God, wiſely to behaue our ſelues vnder the croſſe, affirmeth that it is a gift from God, of whom onely we muſt looke to craue it: if any man, ſaith he, lacke wiſedome, let him aske it of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Paciently to beare the croſſe, and wiſely and well to behaue our ſelues in our afflictions, being a gift from God; what hope haue we to obtaine it by asking of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>: Three wayes are we here to conceiue hope of obteining this wiſedome from God.</p>
               <p n="1">1 From the promiſe we haue from God that hee will heare when we call, open when we knocke, giue when we aske it of him: almightie God aſſureth vs of this hope by his Prophet, by whom he willeth vs in the dayes of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.</note> ſpeake I wil heare them. Our bleſſed ſauiour inuiteth vs to
<pb facs="tcp:19545:34"/> pray by this hope of obtaining: aske and you ſhall haue, ſeeke and you ſhall finde, knocke and it ſhall be opened vnto you: therefore in another place he aſſureth his, that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 14.</note> whatſoeuer they ſhall aske in his name, he would doe it, that the father might be glorified in the ſonne. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in that day ſhall you aske me nothing: verily, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſay vnto you, whatſoeuer you ſhall aske the father <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 16.</note> in my name, he will giue it you: hitherto haue you asked nothing in my name, aske and you ſhal receiue, that your ioy may be full. And the Apoſtle in this place promiſeth that if we aske, we ſhall receiue the wiſdome we pray for. Seeing then wee haue promiſe to obtaine whatſoeuer we aske at the hands of our heauenly father, if we aske it according to his will: And particularly Saint <hi>Iames</hi> here <note place="margin">1. <hi>John</hi> 5.</note> promiſeth that wiſdome ſhall be giuen vs, when we aske it of God: then is there great hope we shall obtaine it, let vs therefore aske it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As from the promiſe is made vs that we shal obtaine, ſo from the liberalitie of God we muſt conceiue hope of obteining the thing we pray for. God giueth to euery man liberally: shall he not giue vs wiſdome, who is liberall to all men? Shall we diſtruſt his goodneſſe, who is rich to all <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom,</hi> 10.</note> that call vpon him? Shall we ſuſpect his bountifulneſſe, which powreth out plentifully his bleſſings vpon al flesh? <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> So liberall is our God, that he hath not ſpared his owne ſonne, but hath giuen him for vs all vnto death: how ſhall he not together with him giue vs all things alſo? Such is the bountie and liberalitie of our God, that he doth not lade man onely, but all liuing creatures with his goodnes, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.</note> who daily waite vpon him, that he may giue them meate in due ſeaſon. God giueth it them, and they gather it: he openeth his hands, and they are filled with goodneſſe, ſaith the holie Prophet. Such is his goodneſſe toward all fleſh, as that he giueth food to the beaſts, &amp; meate to the yong rauens which call vpon him. Shall he carie a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.</note> and prouident care ouer all his creatures; and ſhall he not heare the ſupplications of men, whom hee hath made a little lower then the angels, to crowne them with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.</note>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:19545:34"/> glorie and worſhip aboue other creatures? Shal he heare the beaſts of the field, and the birdes of the aire when they crie to him for ſuſtenance; and ſhall hee not heare men, who vnder the croſſe call vpon him for wiſdome to beare it to his glorie? Shall he giue liberally to all men, and ſhall he not giue vs wiſdome when we pray therefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his heauenly maieſtie? he is liberall towardes all, and whie ſhould we any of vs all doubt of his goodneſſe? wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if God giue liberally vnto all men, there is great cauſe that wee ſhould conceiue hope of obteining this wiſedome at the hands of God, who is ſo liberall to all men.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, we haue hope to obteine this wiſedome at the handes of God, from the goodneſſe of his nature: he giueth his gifts liberally to all men, and hee vpbraideth none, neither caſteth any man in the teeth, either with his benefites ſo plentifully powred vppon vs, or with our beggerlineſſe and miſerable want whereunto we are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; therefore is there great hope of obtaining the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome we pray for.</p>
               <p>Men when they haue done any good turne to any, if they be neuer ſo little offended, they caſt men in the teeth with the benefites they haue done them, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid them with the good turne they haue ſhewed; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men are loath to make requeſt to ſuch for any thing, neither can they bee perſwaded they ſhall obtaine, when they meete with ſuch diſpoſitions and natures. But ſuch a one is not God, for he giueth to all men liberally, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth none, but ſuch as are more vngratefull and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of his benefites then bruite beaſts themſelues. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God then is bountifull of nature, and giueth to all men liberally, and without vpbraiding, enuie, malignitie, beſtoweth his bleſſings vpon vs: then is there great hope of obtaining this wiſedome at his mercifull hands, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apoſtle here aſſureth vs: If any man lack wiſdome, let him aske it of God, who giueth to euery man liberally, and vpbraideth no man, and it ſhall be giuen him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 But how ſhall we aske this wiſdome? hovv ſhall we
<pb facs="tcp:19545:35"/> pray for the gift of pacience, that wee may obtaine it? in the laſt and fourth place, the Apoſtle teacheth vs, if we aske it in faith and wauer not. Faith therefore in all the praiers of Gods Saints is neceſſarie, neither is there anie thing which more hindereth the graunts of God towards man, then when they doubt or wauer in their praiers, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting either the power of god, as not able: or his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as not willing to heare vs in the daies of our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: which diſtruſtfulneſſe and wauering, is no ſmall euill in the ſight of God: neither is it a light matter to doubt of obtaining that thou deſireſt, wherby thy double heart and wauering minde is deſcried, who in asking pretendeſt hope, in wuering a diſtruſteſt either the power, or prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or readineſſe of God to giue thee the deſire of thy heart and to doubt either of his power, or promptneſſe &amp; readineſſe of minde, is great impietie, diſloialtie, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> therefore writing to <hi>Vitalis,</hi> moſt chriſtianly remooueth all doubfulneſſe and waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 107.</note> from our praiers, to which purpoſe he ſaith, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, &amp; be it far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, that what we deſire God to do for vs with our mouthes and voices, we ſhould denie him to be able to do in our hearts &amp; cogitations. Men not fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the power &amp; readineſſe of God, to heare them and graunt the things they pray for, turne many reaſons, and diſpute for and againſt in themſelues, whether it were good or no, to aske ſuch and ſuch things at the hands of God: by which meanes their minds being diſtracted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diuers opinions, and caried thereby hither and thither, obtaine not thoſe things they thus doubtfully deſire, but rather thereby teach God to denie them. Wherefore <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> in his Tragedies ſaith truly, he that asketh fearefully <note place="margin">In Hippolito.</note> and doubtfully, teacheth him to denie of whom hee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: and men doubting they ſhall not obtaine, make God vnwilling to heare them. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> to like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sup.</hi> 7. <hi>Mat.</hi>
                  </note> ſaith: If he that asketh obtaineth, and he that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth findeth: and he that knocketh, hath the doore ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto him: then is it apparant that he hath not asked, ſought, knocked as he ſhould, to whom is not giuen: who
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19545:35"/> findeth not, to whom it is not opened when he knocketh, and why? becauſe of vnbeleefe, doubtfulneſſe, and waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, the greateſt enemie to the efficacie of our praiers. The Apoſtle therefore, in the obtaining of this heauenly wiſdome, to beare the croſſe of Chriſt as is conuenient, &amp; beſt ſerueth for his glorie, remoouing all doubtfull waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the Saints, vvilleth that they aske this wiſdome in aſſured hope, and vnfeined faith, that it might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: wherefore he ſaith, If any man want vviſedome, let him aske it of God, vvho giueth to euerie man liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and vpbraideth none, and it ſhall bee giuen him: but let him aske it in faith, and wauer not.</p>
               <p>By faith our praiers are ſtrengthned and made effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vvith God, wherein approching to God by praier, we are heard. The princely Prophet teacheth vs, that God is neare to ſuch as call vpon him: yet onely ſuch as call <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.</note> vpon him faithfully. Our bleſſed Sauiour in the holie Goſpell aſſureth vs of obteining what we aske, beleeuing <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marke</hi> 11.</note> and not doubting to obtaine it. The holy Apoſtle and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of Chriſt S. <hi>John,</hi> proteſteth that whatſoeuer we aske <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.</note> of God, according to his wil, he would giue vs &amp; when do we aske according to the wil of God, rather then when in aſſurance of faith, and in vndoubted hope of obteining, we drawe neere to the throne of his grace and mercie by praier? Wherefore as when men perſwade themſelues of the goodnes and liberalitie of men, and nothing doubt but they ſhall obtaine, they are then caried haſtily to make ſuite vnto them: So when we are perſwaded to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, we then ſooneſt pray vnto God. And as we muſt be thus perſvvaded of men, if wee looke to obtaine: ſo muſt we perſvvade our ſelues of God, that he is both able and willing to graunt our praiers, if vve looke to obtaine anie thing at the handes of the Lord: vvhereof the Apoſtle to perſvvade vs, vvilleth that if vve will obtaine this vviſdom from God, we muſt aske it in faith vvithout wauering, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe our praiers are turned into ſinne: for whatſoeuer <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>Againſt</hi> 2. <hi>epiſt. Pelag.</hi>
                  </note> is not of faith is ſinne, as auoucheth the Apoſtle. And S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thereunto ſubſcribeth: Our righteouſneſſe is
<pb facs="tcp:19545:36"/> diſcerned from vnrighteouſnes, not by the law of vvorks, but of faith, without which faith, whatſoeuer ſeeme good works, are ſins, &amp; turned into ſins, neither is it likely ſuch praiers ſhould be heard and obtained, becauſe they pleaſe not God, vvhom to pleaſe vvithout faith is impoſſible, as affirmeth the Apoſtle. Let vs therefore vvhen vvee aske <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</note> vviſdome paciently to beare the croſſe impoſed and laide vpon vs; vvhen vve aske faith to be confirmed and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened in Gods promiſes; vvhen vve aske forgiueneſſe of ſinne, and vvith God to be reconciled: vvhen vve aske re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of paine, reliefe of bodie, comfort in diſtreſſe, health in ſickneſſe, eaſe in miſerie, or vvhatſoeuer other thing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touching the ſoule, or concerning the neceſſitie of this preſent vvorld, pray euermore in faith, and hold faſt the counſell vvhich in this particular the Apoſtle giueth: If any man lacke vviſdome, let him aske it of God, vvho giueth to euery man liberally, and vpbraideth none, and it ſhall be giuen him: but let him aske in faith and vvauer not. And thus the Apoſtle by preuenting, turneth avvay and anſvvereth that obiection vvhich might haue beene made againſt him by the Saints: We vvould faine count it exceeding ioy vvhen vve fall into temptations, but this paſſeth our povver and ſtrength, neither are vve able to do this of our ſelues. Hereunto the Apoſtle anſvvereth: that paciently to beare the croſſe is the ſpeciall gift of GOD: and therefore the gift of pacience is to bee deſired from him, vvhereunto theſe wordes in the fift, and part of the ſixt verſes pertaine, If any man lacke wiſedome, &amp;c. Let vs therefore pray vnto God, from whom as all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo all wiſedome proceedeth, that he would vouchſafe vs his holy ſpirit in all our temptations and afflictions, to guide vs, and to power this heauenly wiſedome into our hearts, that in all things we being ſubiect to his will, may in our afflictions and calamities glorifie him here, and be glorified of him in the life to come, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord: to whom with the father and the holy Ghoſt, be all honour and glory, now and for euermore.

               <p>For men thus to be carried away in prayer is a great euill; in our ſuites to God to propoſe no certaintie; in our ſupplications to God to reſt vpon nothing; in our petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alwaies to ſhake and wauer, and neuer aime ſtedelie at any particulars; in theſe our neceſſities to be betwixt hope and feare, and alwaies wauering; now to thinke this thing, now that; now to beleeue, now to diſtruſt; now to be of courage, now to faint in heart; nowe to aſſure our ſelues, now to diſpaire of his mercie; now to reſt and relie vpon his power and ptomiſe, now to fall away through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie; is no doubt like to the waues of the ſea, which are now here, now there; toſt and carried away of the windes. This in conſtancie the Apoſtle condemneth; this inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie Saint <hi>Iames</hi> reproueth in this place by this ſimily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and compariſon; he that wauereth is like a waue of the ſea, toſte of the winde and caried a way. This is a great euill and ſinne, worthily to be reproued. As almightie God in all other things condemneth inconſtancie and wauering of the minde of men, ſo eſpecially in our praiers and ſupplications of him in any part or poynte to dowte or wauer, either touching his power, or concerninge his promptnes and readines to heare and helpe vs, is no ſmal ſinne, neither lightly by him regarded, whereof the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to put vs in minde, condemneth it as great vanitie; he that wauereth is as a waue of the ſea toſt of the winde and caried away.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As by this plaine compariſon and ſimilitude this dowtefullnes and inconſtancie is condemned; So in like manner by a reaſon from diſcomoditie and diſaduantage which followeth this wauering: the reaſon is this: That which bringeth no good vnto men, but procureth hurte rather, ought not to be vſed among the Saints of God; but our wauering in praier, bringeth no benefite vnto vs,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:38"/> but this hurte; that it maketh vs vnfit to receue any thing at the hands of God; therefore all dowting and wauering in praier muſt be lefte and remoued from vs.</p>
               <p>That it maketh vs vnfit to receaue any thing at the hands of God, who is ſo blinde that ſeeth not, ſo wayward that confeſſeth not? If a man ſhould come to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and ſay: Sir I haue a ſuite vnto you, but I doubt I ſhal not obteine it, for I feare either you cannot, or at leaſt you will not performe my deſire: Doeth he not ſtop and ſtay the hand of the geuer, doeth he not make himſelfe vnwor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy to receaue any thing, that is ſo doubtfull? Shall it not be replied, ſhall I doe for him that hath me in iealouſie &amp; ſuſpition that I will not helpe him, and doubteth of my good nature and franke heart towards him? Thus man doubting to obteine of man, getteth nothing: euen like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if in our hearts we ſay to God, I doubt thou wilt not geue me, I feare thou wilt not heare me; wee obtaine by prayer nothing at the hands of God, becauſe we doubt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his power, or els of his liberalitie and bountie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs. For as a conſtant perſwaſion and good aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods fauour, highly commendeth our praiers to him, ſo the doubting of our mindes, the wauering of our hearts, eſtrangeth and alienateth his affection from vs, that we obteine nothing.</p>
               <p>Wherence is it then that many praying, obteine not the things they pray for? Is it not herence, that they pray with wauering mindes, and doubting? Who ſo then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth before God with a doubtful and diſtruſtfull minde, wauering in heart hether and thether, muſt not thinke to obteine any thing at the hands of God: much leſſe then muſt he hope to obteine this excellent gift of wiſdome, whereby wee patiently beare all the afflictions of this world without murmuring. Yea ſo farre are ſuch from obteining their deſire of God, as that by their diſtruſtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes they prouoke him to anger. As then the infidelitie of the Iewes ſhutte (as it were) the doare of heauen from them, ſo that it was not opened vnto them; that as they entred not (through their vnbeleeſe) into Canaan, a type <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 58. <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 24.</note> record; ſo in like manner, the infidelitie and doubting of our mindes hideth the face of God from our prayers, that he will not heare vs; when our ſelues cannot be accepted, neither our praiers welcome vnto him, vnles we come before him in aſſurance of obteining without wauering. For this is a true poſition, and principle of the Apoſtle, that hee which doubteth and wauereth, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue nothing at the hands of God. If then this doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and wauering bring with it this diſcommoditie, that thereby we are made vncapable of the benefites &amp; graces of God, it ſtandeth vs then vpon by all meanes poſſible to beware of doubting and wauering in prayer. And this is his ſeconde reaſon whereby this wauering is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The laſt reaſon whereby he condemneth this, is from a ſentence generally receiued of all men; which he propoſeth (as it were) prouerbially. A double minded man is vnſtable in all his waies, therfore wauering in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is condemned.</p>
               <p>A double minded man here is he, which is carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with ſundrie cogitations about the ſame matter; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth he what way to take to, and what certeinly to follow. This man is inconſtant and vnſtable in al his wayes. Vnſtable, which is deducted and deriued from the Commonwealth, which hauing lawes and orders whereby <note place="margin">

The Commonwealth thereby hath her quietnes and ſtabilitie, whatſoeuer hindereth and letteth the proſperous quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the commonwealth, whatſoeuer is againſt good lawes and orders; as, ſedition, tumults, vprores, tyrannicall empire and bearing rule, and the like; is called vnſtable: ſo in like manner in the minde of man, whileſt reaſon ruleth and executeth her office, the affections of man continue in their place, and mans minde reſteth in her quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution:
<pb facs="tcp:19545:39"/> but if the affections breake the boundes which <note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> reaſon prefixeth, there riſeth diſordernes and inſtabilitie.</p>
               <p>He therefore which doubting and wauering praieth, hath a diſturbed and diſordered minde, and hath in him an vprore and tumult of affections, which follow another thing then faith preſcribeth, therefore is here ſaide to be vnſtable in all his waies, diſquieted, diſordered, diſturbed in all his actions, all his thoughts, all his enterpriſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he endeuoureth: So that this vvauering, doubting, and doublenes of minde, vvhereby vve ſtand in a quanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and mammaring, vvhether vve be beloued of God or no; vvhether he vvill heare vs or not; vvhether he vvill accept of vs, and graunt our praiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or othervviſe; peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, vveakneth, diſordereth, and turneth vp ſide dovvn all Chriſtian duetie and pietie, and the vvhole life of man. Which the Apoſtle doeth ſignifie more ſignificatiuely in the tongue vvherein he vvrote, by the vvorde vnſtable. A double minded man is vnſtable in all his vvayes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vve may learne, that the foundation and ſtablenes of all godly actions, and ſpecially of all holy and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prayers, ſtandeth in doctrine, in Gods vvill, in faith, vvithout vvhich our vvhole life is diſordered, confuſed, diſturbed. And thus theſe three vvayes the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the vnſtablenes, doubting, &amp; vvauering of men in prayer.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being more plaine then that they need any further enlarging, let vs novv ſee vvhat doctrine may out of the former place &amp; this, be gathered. 1.

               <p n="2">2 That the Apoſtle maketh praier the meane and vvay to attaine vnto vviſedome, vvherein hee vvoulde
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19545:39"/> men to remoue all wauering and doubting; it eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth thoſe fantaſticall ſpirites which condemne prayer as ſuperfluous, God (ſay they) knoweth our need, &amp; ſeeth our want before we aske, he will for his fatherly goodnes ſupplie this want without asking: he heareth the inwarde ſighings and ſobs of the ſpirite, and knoweth what the ſpirite meaneth, therefore is prayer in Gods children ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous. Indeed, if God, becauſe he knoweth our need, and heareth the ſorowfull ſighings of the Saints, Woulde therefore ſupplie our want without asking, then were prayer ſuperfluous: but to be therfore ſuperfluous, becauſe he knoweth our needes and neceſſities, is a reaſon carnal, ſenſuall and deuiliſh.</p>
               <p>For were this carnal reaſon ſufficient, God knoweth our needes before we pray, therefore praier is ſuperfluous; why doeth the Apoſtle here will vs, If any man lacke wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to aske it of God? God knoweth our infirmities, he ſeeth our impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, he beholdeth the vnablenes of mans nature, he ſeeth whether in afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s we behaueour ſelues as is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient: notwithſtanding the apoſtle willeth vs to aske this point of wiſdom from God. Neither Saint <hi>Iames</hi> here onely commendeth praier as needfull, but the whole courſe of the Scriptures of God require it in the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men, as an inſtrument moſt neceſſarie. Almighty God though he knew our troubles, whereinto by his will we ſhould be plunged, yet commaundeth hee vs in our troubles to call vpon him for deliuerance. The Lorde <note place="margin">

The hearts of the Apoſtles were knowen, and it was needefull for the accompliſhing of their miniſterie, that to the eleuen, a twelfth Apoſtle in <hi>Iudas</hi> his place might be ſubſtitute: yet in that ſo heauenly a buſines they pray to God for direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <note place="margin">

               <p>What: haue not the holy Patriarkes, haue not the bleſſed Apoſtles, haue not the Saints of God in all times vſed praier? May it then be iudged as ſuperfluous?</p>
               <p>What: haue we either to ſupplie our bodely neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or to miniſter to our ſpirituall wants, as of our ſelues, and may we not truely of both ſay, We haue nothing but what we haue receaued? And vvhereby doe vvee receaue <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.</note> theſe things from the hands of God? Is it not by praier? Is it not neceſſarie then in all? The Poet ſaith vvell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that praier profiteth both poore and rich alike, when it is vſed; and hurteth both children and olde men, being neglected.</p>
               <p>Men praye therefore to God, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, <note place="margin">

               <p>Seeing then no man can be ſo blinde (vnleſſe he vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtoppe his eies againſt the light of the trueth) but needes confeſſeth praier to be a thing moſt neceſſarie in the life of man; vvhich neither man nor vvoman, rich nor poore, learned nor ignorant, Prince nor people, one nor other can vvant altogether; but is the onely meane and inſtrument vvherby all the treaſures of God, repoſed and laide vp in ſtore for his Saints in Ieſus Chriſt, are plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully poured out vpon men: then notvvithſtanding this, to holde it as ſuperfluous in the Saints, is not onely like Gyants to fight againſt God and his trueth, but as hauing put off the vvhole nature of men, and transformed into the ſhape of bruite beaſtes, to ſtriue and contende againſt the courſe of nature it ſelfe: vvhich vvho ſo doe, are not onely vvorthy to be ſecluded the ſocietie of the Saintes, but alſo to be ſequeſtred and put out from the companie of men.</p>
               <p>Were there then no other place in all holy ſcripture to commend prayer as a thing moſt neceſſarie vnto men, yet vvere this one al-ſufficient, that the Apoſtle S. <hi>James</hi> here maketh it the meane to attaine vnto vviſdome. If any man lack vviſdome, let him aske it of God.</p>

The humbling of vs by affliction in this worlde, is the exalting of vs to glorie before God: the caſting downe of vs here by the croſſe, is the lifting of vs vp to heauen before the Lorde: the aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of our ſelues vnder the diuers temptations of this life, is the aduanncing of vs in the kingdome of Chriſt.

As then our Sauiour Chriſt beeing by affliction and death it ſelfe humbled by the father, was therefore, and thereby exalted vnto great glorie: euen ſo if paciently we ſuffer the triall of our faith by afflictions, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.</note> and ſuffer our ſelues thereby by God to be humbled, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by pouertie, whether by contempt; whether by calamitie whatſoeuer: if we fixe and faſten not our eies vpon the preſent miſeries, but lift vp our hearts, and caſt our cogitations vpon the glorie whereof we ſhall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, we ſhall alſo be exalted: ſo that we haue great and iuſt cauſe to reioice vnder the croſſe, whereunto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle exhorteth: Let the brother of lowe degree reioice when he is exalted.</p>
               <p>Nowe as the croſſe and afflictions are profitable to the poore brother, and brother of lowe degree, who thereby is exalted: ſo alſo is this doctrine needfull and profitable to the rich. Againe, ſaith he, He that is rich, let him reioice in that he is made low: wherein is taught how men which haue al things at wil, ſhould behaue themſelues in wealth, that they waxe not proud of their abundance and plentie, neither truſt too much to the frailtie of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, but alwayes to looke to the croſſe which followeth them, which if it be laied on them, therein they ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice alſo, When God then taketh away, and remoueth the flattering and deceitfull baites of this world from rich men, and ſo they become contemptible vnto others; if he turne their wealth into wo, their mirth into mourning, their plentie into pouertie, their abundance into want, their worldly happineſſe into miſerie: in this their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling are they exhorted by the Apoſtle to reioice, for thereby many occaſions of many ſinnes are remoued; and therefore rich men, by ſpoile of goodes, loſſe of wealth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of riches, or what other way ſoeuer tried, in that they are humbled, muſt reioice. Seeing then in the ſtate of this life there is great occaſion miniſtred of impacience both in the poore and low degree of men, and alſo in the rich and plenteous eſtate of men, the onely ſalue of both their ſores, is in all changes and chaunces of this life, to
<pb facs="tcp:19545:45"/> behaue themſelues pacient vnder the croſſe: and thus is the doctrine here deliuered, profitable for poore and rich, as the Apoſtle teacheth: Let the brother of lowe degree reioyce in that he is exalted: and againe, the rich, in that he is humbled.</p>
               <p>If any obiect here, that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> willeth the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of low degree to reioyce when he is exalted: and the rich man when he is made low, and humbled, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth contrarie to other Scriptures, where we are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iere.</hi> 9.</note> to reioyce onely in God, as by the Prophet <hi>Ieremie,</hi> men are commanded neither to reioice in their wiſdome, riches, ſtrength, nor any other thing, but in that they know God which executeth iudgement, equitie and iuſtice on earth. And by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who aduiſeth men to reioice in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Philp.</hi> 4.</note> the Lord onely: Reioice in the Lord alway, and againe I ſay reioice.</p>
               <p>Hereunto the anſwere is eaſie: 1. If we acknowledge whatſoeuer happeneth vnto vs, to be from God, who both woundeth and healeth; caſteth down and lifteth vp; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth, and exalteth: then either in our low degree being <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings</hi> 2.</note> exalted, or in our riches and plentie being humbled: to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice, is to reioice in that God ſendeth, and ſo to reioice in the Lord. 2. If againe we looke into our owne wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who of our ſelues haue nothing, but whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we haue, we haue receiued it: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the things which we haue receiued from the hands of God moderately to <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.</note> reioice, is alſo to reioice in the Lord, who is the fountaine and well-head of all graces and bleſſings. 3. Finally, if we hold this as a ground and foundation, that all good <note place="margin">1. <hi>Per.</hi> 5.</note> gifts flowing vnto man, grow of his meere fauour and mercy, &amp; not from any merit or deſert of ours, then in the good bleſſings of God, of exaltation, aduauncement, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or other whatſoeuer to reioice, is godly, chriſtian, and dutifull: and thus men reioycing, reioice in the Lorde. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> then in exhorting the brother of lowe degree to reioice when he is exalted, and the rich in like maner when he is made lowe and humbled, is in all points anſvverable vnto other Scriptures: vvherein vve

And thus all their pompe, glorie, wealth, earthly felicitie, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine.

And thus the Apoſtle proueth by the diſtinguiſhing of the perſons of men, that the doctrine of the croſſe, and the patient bearing of the ſame, is profitable to all men, both to poore and rich, and ſo to all.</p>
               <p>The perſons thus diſtinguiſhed; the next &amp; ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thing in theſe verſes, which is the fourth and laſt thing in the <note place="margin">Fourth thing in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the croſse.</note> whole treatie of the croſſe, and comfort taking therein, is the concluſion.

In which concluſion fiue things may be obſerued.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The reward it ſelfe promiſed to ſuch as patiently endure the croſſe, which the Apoſtle noteth vnder the word bleſſed: Bleſſed is that man that endureth temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Bleſſednes is the greateſt of all rewards geuen vnto men, wherein whatſoeuer is good, is conteined: the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle therefore to pricke them forward, and to ſtirre them on to pacience, promiſeth happines and bleſſednes to thoſe that endure te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Our Sauiour Chriſt entreating of the reward which the poore in ſpirite; that is, ſuch as by <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.</note> ſundrie miſeries and calamities (which are ioyned with pouertie) were afflicted, promiſeth them happines and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie: Bleſſed are the poore in ſpirite for theirs is the king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom of heauen.

               <p>Thus then if we endure pouertie, and miſeries therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to annexed, if we endure temptation of perſecution, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, reproach, and ſuch like, we are pronounced bleſſed.

And a little after touching the reward of our patient abiding and ſuffering for Chriſt, he calleth

Who then is ſpoiled of his goods for Chriſtes profeſſion, who ſuffereth perſecution for Chriſtian religion, who endureth impriſonment for the teſtimonie of his conſcience, who abideth patiently the triall of his faith by ſundrie temptations, is both by Chriſt and his holy Apoſtles, accounted bleſſed: The rewarde of our patience then is happines and felicitie.</p>
               <p>Wherein the Apoſtles defend a paradoxe, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion contrarie vnto the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of men of this world, for the world holdeth them onely for happie, who abound in wealth, who haue all things at their pleaſures &amp; willes, who neuer come into any misfortune, neither are vexed or afflicted with any miſerie or calamitie. But ſuch as are preſſed with pouerty, diſtreſſed with greefe, tempted by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, aſſaulted with miſerie, ſubiect to calamitie; theſe they count for curſed miſerable, &amp; of all men moſt wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, as they in the Prophet counted our Sauiour to bee <note place="margin">

From whoſe iudgement and opinion Saint <hi>James</hi> diſſenting, calleth and counteth them which endure temptations happie. Let worldlings then count proſperitie their felicitie: let Epicures count plenteouſnes of bread their happines: let greene and flouriſhing youth make the deſiers of their hearts their bliſſe: let other men count worldly delights, carnall pleaſure, wicked mammo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vaine pompe, quiet reſt, and continuall ſecuritie, their cheereſt good and only ioy in this world, yet with <hi>Iames</hi> muſt all the Saints count the triall of their faith, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe of their patience, the bearing of the croſſe, the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of affliction, the enduring of temptations, their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines and felicitie, and holde the ſentence of the Apoſtle for ſure, Bleſſed is the man that endureth temptations.</p>
               <p>If happines and felicitie be the reward of our patience,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19545:48"/> and all men by inſtinct of nature deſire happines, as the very heathen philoſophers haue in their learned writings plentifully diſcourſed; ſhall there be any man or woman ſo careleſſe of himſelfe, ſo voide of reaſon, ſo farre from knowledge, ſo great an enemie to his ſoules health, which ſhall refuſe the burthen of the croſſe, ſeeing patient endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance purchaſeth our happines? Let vs in the feare of God, addreſſe our ſelues to the bearing of the croſſe; let vs arme our ſelues againſt the day of affliction; let vs in full aſſurance of hope, indure the temptations which are laide vpon vs: that thus induring, we may receiue our ful reward, euen eternal bleſſednes for euer.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This reward of our endura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhal then be geuen when we are tried: the crowne is promiſed after our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: the hire is rendred after our labour: If then wee will enioy the reward, and haue our bleſſednes in the king dome of God, then muſt we in this world be tried by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The doctrine of this place is, that we muſt firſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer before we be rewarded; firſt be tried, before we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced. Which thing Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preacheth vnto <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie,</hi> ſetting downe the labour before the hire; and the contending before the crowne. No man (ſaith he) is crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</note> except he ſtriue lawfully. The ſame Apoſtle ſetteth downe his trauel before his reward, and his labour before his recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, when he ſaith; I haue fought a good fight, I haue finiſhed my courſe, I haue kept the faith, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth therefore is the crowne of righteouſnes laide vp for me, which the righteous iudge ſhall geue mee at that day, and not me onely, but all thoſe that loue his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. There is no price where there is no ſtriuing; there is no garland where there is no goale to runne to; there is no crowne where there is no triall of maſteries; there is no victorie where there is no enemie; there is no hire where there is no labor; there is no happines where there is no triall by temptation.</p>
               <p>Now the full triall of man is not at once or twiſe, but in the whole courſe of his life, ſo that the whole life of man is nothing els but a continuall triall and warfare vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19545:49"/> earth, ſtriuing and ſtrugling againſt all afflictions, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, calamities, and troubles of this world In which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and conflict, if we acquit our ſelues like men, and in inuincible conſtancie endure temptations, to the end, we ſhall bee bleſſed: whereof our Sauiour Chriſt aſſureth <note place="margin">

And the Angell to the Church of Smyrna: Be thou conſtant and faithfull vnto death, and I will giue thee the crowne of life. When therefore to the ende of our life, and in the whole courſe thereof, we bee pacient: when to the ful meaſure of our trial which is in the ende of this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall condition, we endure temptations; then ſhall we bee bleſſed: for bleſſed is the man which endureth tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for when hee is tried he ſhall receiue the crowne of life.</p>
               <p>If our trial then muſt goe before our happines which is geuen vs in reward; and our labour before our hire; then do thoſe Chriſtians flatter and deceue them ſelues, who thinke to be pertakers of this reward without affliction in this life; Seing the triall of our faith by troubles muſt goe before our happines. Vaine therefore and ſlouthfull, too dainty and too delicate are they, who refuſing the burden of the croſſe, and the induring temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; hope to attaine to this happines by wallowing in wealth, by ſtretching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues vpon their beddes of downe, by pampering and puffing vp of their fleſh with riotous life, by pricking and prankinge vp them ſelues in intollerable pride, by weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and waſting their bodies with carnall pleaſures, with liuing at harts eaſe and in all ſecuritie in this world: for the Apoſtle promiſeth reward of happines only vnto them that endure temptations, and then too only to be giuen, when they are fully tried by affliction. Wherefore as this bleſſing is promiſed only if we endure temptation, ſo is it giuen alſo then when our triall is finiſhed, &amp; in the meane time to be looked for in a ſound hope.</p>
               <p n="3">3 To ſhew the excellencie and greatnes of this reward and of our heauenly happines in the kingdom of God, the ſacred ſcripture diuerſly compareth it, but moſt ſpecially

                     <hi>James</hi> 1.</note> the happie reward of the Saints pacience to crownes: Bleſſed is the man that endureth temptation, for when he is tried he ſhall receiue the crowne of life.</p>
               <p>There is old heauing and ſhouing among men in the world for crownes, and great ſtrife &amp; cruell warres among princes, who ſhall weare each others crowne: and their labour, trauell, ſhouing, is commonly vnlawful, from their ambicious and couetous deſires of their hearts: and when all is done, their crownes are corruptible and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. Shall not the Saints ſtriue with all Chriſtian forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and courage againſt the miſeries and calamities of this life, that when they are tried, they may receiue an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall crowne of glorie?</p>
               <p>All men naturally are deſirous of life, and they often ſeeke euill and vnlawfull meanes and wayes to prolong their life, which yet is but momentanie: And ſhall not the children of God, in much affliction, in manifold mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, in ſundrie temptations, in all the chaunges and chaunces of this world, acquit themſelues like men, that paciently bearing the triall of their faith, they may in fine receiue the crowne of eternall life.</p>

               <p> 4 To which crowne men attaine not vnto for their worke of pacience, as if our pacience deſerued this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: but they enioy and receiue it by the promiſe of God. The crowne of life is not then a due and deſerued hire, but a free reward of our labour from the bountie of God, who regardeth not ſo much what we deſerue, as what of his liberalitie he hath promiſed. Wherein he doth as a naturall father, who promiſeth his ſonne, that if he will do this or that, hee will make him lorde and heire of all his lands and liuing, which farre paſſeth that which the child hath deſerued, yet that done, the father perfourmeth that he promiſeth, not looking ſo much to the obedience of his ſonne, as to his owne promiſe: euen ſo doth God, wherefore the Apoſtle here ſo much to note vnto vs, ſaith, that ſuch as are tried ſhall receiue the crowne of life by promiſe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in like maner ſpeaketh, I haue <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.</note> fought a good fight, I haue finiſhed my courſe, I haue kept the faith: henchforth is there laid vp for me a crowne of righteouſneſſe: which leaſt he might ſeeme arrogantly to haue chalenged for his worke, he referreth the gift there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnto God: which God (ſaith hee) ſhall giue me: if it were giuen of God, then not deſerued of <hi>Paul.</hi> So that the rewarde of our obedience and vertue is giuen vs, not for the deſert and merite of our workes, but for the truth of Gods promiſe, who as he truly promiſeth, ſo he faithfully performeth rewardes of righteouſneſſe to his ſaints and ſeruants, and giueth eternall life to men of his free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</note> according to the doctrine of the Apoſtle: eternall life is the gift of God through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p>If the crowne of life be not purchaſed and deſerued by our works, but onely be giuen by promiſe, and of grace: why do ſo many ſcriptures promiſe happines, life, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, and glorie, ſo often rather mencioning works then faith vnto men? It ſeemeth therefore that happineſſe and eternall life are the hire and due reward of our workes of righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>For anſwere whereof it is worthie the obſeruation: 1. That the holy Ghoſt in all the Scripture ſpeaketh accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:19545:51"/> to the capacitie of man, applying it ſelf to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our wittes: and ſo in the doctrine of workes hee doth ſo alſo, oftner mencioning workes then faith, becauſe works are more familiar then faith, being an inward ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. 2. Seeing God hath made vs capable of reaſon, and hath giuen vs deſire, will, and iudgement, whereby we are caried ſometimes to that is good, ſometimes to that is euill: therefore it pleaſed the holy Ghoſt oftentimes to mention workes, and to vſe ſundrie exhortations, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, reprehenſions, and reproofes, thereby to ſtirre our deſir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, will and iudgement to that which is good, and to ſhunne and decline the contrarie. 3. Works are tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and tokens, ſignes and teſtimonies of mens faith, which being an internall qualitie and habite of minde, is knowen in it ſelfe onely vnto God: whereof that men might haue knowledge, and might alſo followe it in vs, therefore by workes it muſt be made manifeſt. Therefore are wee willed to make our inwarde man knowen too by good workes. 4. Moreouer men naturally giuen to hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procriſie, would eaſily deceiue, not themſelues onely, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo in a vaine oſtentation and name of faith, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of the fruites of righteouſneſſe, without which our faith is dead, which to ſhew, the Scriptures require works as fruits, in al ſuch as were once iuſtified by faith in Chriſt Ieſus. 5. Wee are eaſily ſtirred vp to the doing of things by rewards, and deterred by puniſhments. That we might by rewards be ſtirred vp to the fruites of righteouſneſſe, therefore doth almightie God promiſe great rewards vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the workes of men, thereby to allure vs to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holineſſe. Which workes he alſo doth worke in vs, for he worketh in man both the will and the deed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pleaſure: Wherfore when he crowneth our <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.</note> vertues and good workes in vs, which he himſelfe onely worketh in vs, he crowneth not our merits, but his owne gifts: as notably auoucheth Saint <hi>Anguſtine:</hi> So then by <note place="margin">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19545:51"/> mention workes, not thereby to merit, but by promiſe of reward to allure to vertue. 6. The Scriptures mention vvorkes ſo often to teach vs our dutie, to be fruitfull in all vvorkes of righteouſneſſe, and in all goodneſſe to imitate Chriſt our example and patterne in all vertue, that vvee might be ſuch vnto chriſtians our brethren, as Ieſus Chriſt vvas to vs, louing, gentle, pacient, bountifull, righteous, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily entreated, readie to forgiue, and plentifull in good workes, and in the fruites of righteouſneſſe, to the glorie of God. 7 Finally, they mention workes, and thereof the rewards are promiſed, to ſhew what ſhall followe our workes of obedience, euen eternall life, not for deſert of workes, but by the grace of God, and according to his mercifull promiſe: as in this place the Apoſtle promiſeth the crowne of life to the pacience of Gods Saints, not for the worke of pacience, but for the promiſe of God, who hath promiſed to rewarde therewith the pacience of his Saints: whoſe pacience is the way and meane, but not the cauſe of their happineſſe. For as the high way is not cauſe of our comming into the Citie, but the meane whereby we come therunto: and as the race or place of running, is not the cauſe of the goale or garland there giuen, but the way and meane therunto: ſo are not our workes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is our pacience the cauſe of our crowne, but the way and meane whereby we come vnto it.</p>
               <p>And that our workes can not cauſe our crowne and eternall bleſſedneſſe, it is manifeſt. 1 If man might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue eternall life, then the workes of men might binde God: but God cannot be bound by vs, becauſe he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>Job.</hi> 53</note> nothing by our workes of righteouſneſſe, as both <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> auouch: therefore wee can not deſerue life. 2 If men could deſerue life, then were not life the gift of God through Ieſus Chriſt, therefore man can not deſerue it. 3 If man could deſerue eternall life, then muſt there be a proportion betwixt that which deſerueth, which is temporall righteouſneſſe, and that which is deſerued, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall happineſſe: and what propoſition is there betwixt things temporall, and things eternall? Inſomuch as <hi>Paul</hi>

In which temptations how ſo euer the inſtruments thereunto vſed by God, be wickedly affected, yet in all thinges reſpecteth he that which tendeth moſt vnto his owne glorie, and the benefite of his Church, and ſo is he neuer to bee charged as the cauſe of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe among men.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Beſide the temptation to proue, there is a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation alſo of preſumption, whereby men are moued to <note place="margin">

               <p>Such is that temptation whereby wee are ſollicited to ſay; I know the goodneſſe of the Lord is great ouer all his creatures; I know he hath a fatherly and prouident care ouer me, and he will not ſee the worke of his owne hande to periſh, for lacke of ſuſtinance: God that giueth clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">

               <p n="3">3 There is finally a temptation which is to deceiue and ſeduce men, drawing them into error, mouing them to euil, ſtirring them forward to iniquitie and vngodlines, aduenturing and enterpriſing any thing repugnant to the law and will of God. Of this there are two kindes alſo. 1 Temptation to deceiue, externall, 2 Temptation to deceiue, internall. Externall temptation, whereby wee are drawen into any ſinne, is that temptation whoſe cauſe is externall and outward, and the beginning therof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vs; as when by Sathan, by the world, and the thinges which here compaſſe vs about, though in ſome ſence they are inward, becauſe they moue our hearts and inwarde parts, yet in as much as the cauſes are without, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of theſe temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s from others then our ſelues, they may be called outward. Sathan tempteth vs by falſe doctrine which he moueth, by offence which he cauſeth, by occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and allurements to euill, which he miniſtreth, and otherwiſe. The cauſe of which temptations, and the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19545:55"/> inſtrument alſo being without, the temptation is called externall. The world to deceiue vs, tempteth by vanitie thereof, by improbitie therein: the vaine pompe of the world tickleth vs, the corruptions therein inuade and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault vs, with the examples of wickedneſſe dayly ſeene of vs: theſe things often ſeduce &amp; deceiue, and the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is outward. The things wherewith we be compaſſed, tempt men manifoldly: power, honour, ambition, pleaſure on the one ſide: feare, daunger and perill, famine, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, pouertie, death on the other: thus are men alſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly tempted, and drawen into the errours and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our common life, and thereby deceiued and led into euill.</p>
               <p>The temptations which ſeduce men, and are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, are ſuch, whoſe immediate and next cauſe is in our ſelues: as man is tempted to commit euill by his owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and concupiſcenſe, mooued by his owne diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red appetite to commit ſinne. Thus haue we in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms a domeſticall tyrant, originall ſinne and natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption from <hi>Adam,</hi> pulling, haling, &amp; drawing vs dayly to euill, that ſinne in all things might exerciſe power ouer vs. Hereunto though Satan helpe, yet the cauſe is in our ſelues, in as much as by him wee are not conſtrained, but come and follow freely, deceiued and ſeduced by our own concupiſcenſe. And of this kinde of temptation the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle chiefly ſpeaketh, when he ſaith: If any man be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, let him not ſay, I am tempted of God. God to proue men, tempteth his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: but to cauſe them to preſume, or to deceiue and draw them to euil, he doth not. So that he is not the cauſe of ſuch temptations, neither may wee referre theſe euil temptations vnto him. And this the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of this place teacheth vs: Let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God.</p>
               <p>If God tempt no man to euill, why ſaith the Scripture, that he hardeneth the heart of <hi>Pharao,</hi> that he blindeth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 7. 10. 11. <hi>Eſai.</hi> 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.</note> man, and giueth him ouer into a reprobate minde? As of <hi>Pharao</hi> in the booke of Exodus, in many places and chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is recorded: of Iſrael the people of God: as in <hi>Iſai,</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:19545:56"/> 
                  <hi>Dauid,</hi> and other Prophets is mencioned: of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles thriſe in the firſt chapter to the Romans is confeſſed: of others in other places in like maner.</p>
               <p>Hereunto it may bee anſwered: firſt, that God in his iudgements, which are ſometimes open, ſometimes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, but alwayes iuſt, moueth and inclineth mens willes whither him luſteth: wherein, hee either with the latter ſinne of man puniſheth the former: or elſe hee taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his grace from men: whereof deſtitute, they runne headlong into their owne deſtruction, by committing ſinne with greedineſſe: or finally, hee bringeth to paſſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.</note> his purpoſe by the wickedneſſe, either of Satan, or men, as able to worke out that which is good by the iniquitie of men: and thus he is alwayes iuſt. So that we may ſay with the Apoſtle, that hee is not the cauſe of our euill temptations. Let no man ſay that when hee is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he is tempted of God. God mooueth not men to euill: hee driueth not men to euill affections: hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilleth wickedneſſe into no mans heart: but partly in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away his ſpirite from them, partly in puniſhing one ſinne with another, partly by bringing to light the ſinnes of men, which before were couered, partly in accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing his owne will, and bringing to paſſe his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate counſailes and purpoſes, euen by euill meanes and inſtruments, as ruling all thinges after his will: he is ſaide to indurate and harden the hearts of men, and to giue them vp to reprobate mindes, as the ſcripture ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>The propoſition of the holy Apoſtle ſtandeth ſtill for true: Let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God. Of this matter more may be ſeene vpon the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Peter,</hi> 3. Chap. v. 17. Rom. 9. 18. v.</p>
               <p>Thus their errour is refuted, who holde that as good motions are inſpired vs from God, ſo euill ſuggeſtions are ſuggeſted by him alſo: ſo that when men ſteale, take away by violence, commit adultery, do iniurie to their brethren, or any ſuch like, they muſt not ſay, we are moued, ſolicited and ſtirred vp thereunto by God. Wherefore the Apoſtle
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19545:56"/> here in his propoſition giueth them admonition: Let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Reaſons."/> 2 This being the propoſition, in the ſecond and next place followeth the confirmation of that propoſition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the arguments and reaſons, why men may not ſay they are tempted of God: which reaſons are three.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon is drawen from the nature of God. God is by nature and of himſelfe, pure, ſimple, holy, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, good: neither doth he admit the darkneſſe of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or deceite, neither moueth or ſolliciteth hee any to errour or euill: he falleth not himſelfe, neither caſteth he any into wickedneſſe. For he being in nature good, pure, holy, cannot be moued to commit euill, neither mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth he any thereunto: wherefore hee is not authour of euill temptations in men.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That God is good, holy, pure, innocent, righteous, and one that hateth ſinne, the Scriptures in ſundry places teach vs. For firſt in the booke of Leuiticus, not once but often it is ſaid, that the Lorde is holy, and therefore the people by like example ought in like maner to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 11. 20. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> the King exhorted his princes, rulers, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, magiſtrates and iudges, to execute iudgement and iuſtice without partialitie or reſpect had of mens perſons: rendering this reaſon, becauſe they executed the iudgement of God, with whom there is no reſpect of perſons, nor any iniquitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> the princely prophet telleth men, that the wicked ſhall not ſtande in Gods ſight, becauſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.</note> GOD hateth all thoſe that committe iniquitie. In an other place hee beareth this recorde of God, that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.</note> he is true in all his ſayings, and holy in all his workes. <hi>Siracides</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Sirach,</hi> would not men to impute <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 15.</note> the cauſe of their ſinnes vnto GOD: becauſe he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all ſinne and wickedneſſe of man, wherefore he thus exhorteth: Say not thou, it is through the Lorde that I turne backe: for thou oughteſt not to do the thing that hee hateth: and ſay not thou, hee hath cauſed mee to erre: for hee hath no neede of
<pb facs="tcp:19545:57"/> the ſinfull man: for the Lorde hateth all abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of errour, and they which feare him, loue it not. Many mo the like places are in ſcripture ſet downe, which affirme of God, that he is holy, righteous. iuſt, and a hater of iniquitie, which all confirme this place of the Apoſtle, who diſputing of the nature of God, ſheweth that hee neither is tempted to euill, neither tempteth any: for which cauſe men ought not to ſay when they are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they were tempted to euill by God. Satan beeing a lyer from the beginning, and not continuing in the truth, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.</note> mooueth men to falſhoode and errour, and not God: the Diuell being the prince of the wickedneſſe and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this world, ſtirreth and ſoliciteth men therein, to wickedneſſe, and tempteth many wayes to euill and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe: for which cauſe he is called the tempter, becauſe he alwayes tempteth men to commit iniquitie and ſinne. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.</note> So doth not God: who is of a pure, perfect, holy, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſition, and neither himſelfe is tempted, neither tempteth he any to euill. Whereupon the Apoſtle, as by his firſt reaſon, here ſheweth, that when men are tempted, they muſt not lay the euil vpon God: neither ſay they were tempted of God, becauſe he neither can be tempted of any to euill, neither tempteth he any.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Another reaſon, why, when men are tempted to euil, they may not ſay they are tempted of god, is drawne from the ſetting downe of the verie true and perfect cauſe of temptations. The true, natural &amp; proper immediate cauſe of temptations, is our owne concupiſcenſe, therefore not God. For there cannot be two or many true, naturall, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, proper, efficient cauſes of one thing. Therefore ſeeing of temptations to euill, we haue the true, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and proper cauſe in our ſelues, euen concupiſcence, and carnall corruption, which dwelleth in vs by original deprauation, we may not make God, but that, the cauſe of our temptations to euill, Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Jouinian</hi> ſaieth, that as in good things God is the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Contra Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinian. Rom.</hi> 9.</note> doer and perfecter: for it is neither in the willer, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the runner, but in GOD which ſheweth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19545:57"/> and helpeth, that we may come vnto the ende: ſo euill things and ſinnes, the ſeede that is in vs, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation and pricker forwarde: but the diuell the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter of all euill. The chiefe and immediate cauſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill temptations is our owne corruption and concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcenſe, which drawing vs away from the rule of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the right path of the commaundementes of God, entiſeth vs: whereof Saint <hi>James</hi> here ſaith: euery man is tempted, when he is drawne away by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcenſe, and is enticed.</p>
               <p>The ſimilitude of entiſing is taken either from beaſts, which hunting after their pray, are oftentimes intangled by the baite of the taker, and purſuite of the hunter: or from birdes which ſeeking for meate, ſpying corne, or breade crummes, or vvormes, or the like baite in the ſnare or pitfolde, or among lime tvvigges, or vnder the net vvhich ſhall ouervvhelme them, are taken, entiſed, and entrapped: or from the fiſh, vvhich greedily gaping and running after the baite of the angler, ſvvallovveth dovvne both baite and hooke, and ſo is deceyued. Euen ſo men through their concupiſcence are drawne avvay, either the ſweetneſſe and pleaſure, either the gaine and profite, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the eaſineſſe and facilitie of a thing propoſed: and ſo are entiſed. Our owne concupiſcenſe therefore drawing vs away, and intiſing to euill, being the naturall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cauſe of euill temptations, wee may not aſcribe our temptations vnto God, but vnto our ſelues: and this is the ſecond reaſon, why, when we are tempted, we may not ſay that wee are tempted of GOD, becauſe, our owne concupiſcenſe, not God, is cauſe of theſe temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="3">3 By occaſion of this place, before hee come to the <note place="margin">The effests of luſt and concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcenſe.</note> third reaſon, he ſetteth downe the effects of this concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, the cauſe of euill temptations, which I noted for the third thing in this diſcourſe. This he doth by a kinde of gradation, or ſlipping from one thing to another: wherof thus ſaieth Saint <hi>James:</hi> Then when luſt hath conceiued, it bringeth foorth ſinne, and ſinne when it is finiſhed,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:58"/> bringeth forth death. In which place he noteth firſt the conception of concupiſcenſe, then the birth: the firſt and the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Touching the conception of concupiſcenſe, it is the aſſent and agreeing of the will, when it poſſeſſeth the affection and will of man: ſo that the aſſenting and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing of our willes to the inticement of concupiſcenſe: is the conception of concupiſcenſe, euen the firſt thing that it worketh in vs. When the luſt and concupiſcenſe of man ſeazeth and reſteth vpon any obiect: whether it be by deſiring: as glorie, riches, pleaſure, or the like: or by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding it: as Gods word, holy life, vertue and godlines, which luſt naturally careth not for: either by hating, as iniuries, oppreſſions, wrongs, rebukes, violence of men, &amp; ſuch like: then is mans luſt ſaid to conceiue. Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe had her conception in <hi>Euah,</hi> when ſhe ſeeing the fruit of the forbidden tree to be faire and pleaſant to the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gene.</hi> 3.</note> eie, her luſt riſing thereupon, and giuing conſent to that iniquitie, luſt in her conceyued. When the Iſraelites ſawe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 25.</note> the daughters of Moab, their luſt ſeazing &amp; reſting about their beautie, luſt conceiued in them. When the children of God ſawe the daughters of men that they were faire, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gene.</hi> 6.</note> their luſt reſting about that matter, and they yeelding conſent to the inticement, concupiſcenſe conceiued ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterie in them. When <hi>Sichem</hi> his luſt reſted vpon <hi>Dinah: Putiphars</hi> wife, vpon <hi>Ioſeph: Dauid,</hi> his luſt vpon the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Barſeba:</hi> they yeelding the conſent of their willes <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gene.</hi> 34. <hi>Gine.</hi> 39. 2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 11. 3 <hi>King.</hi> 21</note> thereunto, luſt conceiued in them. When <hi>Ahab</hi> the king ſet his affection vpon <hi>Naboth</hi> his vineyard, and therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his luſt reſting, yeelding thereunto the conſent of his will, deſire and luſt conceyued in him. Generally, in all ſinne: ſpecially in euerie ſinne, whether it be in deſire to couetouſnes, or in pleaſure to adulterie, or in reuenge to murther, or in ambition to honour: either in diſdaine to contempt, or finally in miſlike to reproch and ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: when our luſt reſteth thereabout, and we giue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of will to the inticement of concupiſcenſe, then doth concupiſcenſe conceiue in vs. Wherefore as in naturall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19545:58"/> procreation, firſt there is conception, then afterwarde birth: ſo, in inward temptations to euill, luſt firſt concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, then is it deliuered, and bringeth forth.</p>
               <p>After conception, in it time, birth and bringing forth followeth: ſo by obtaining conſent of will, luſt concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, at it time bringeth forth alſo. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith: Then when luſt hath conceiued, it bringeth forth, firſt ſinne, then death.</p>
               <p>Here is the former and the latter birth of luſt: firſt it bringeth foorth ſinne, as the immediate thing which after conception once had, followeth: where by ſinne, actuall ſinne is vnderſtoode: ſuch a ſinne as is brought into act, and done in deed, as in the examples before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is manifeſt: <hi>Euah</hi> giuing conſent to concupiſcenſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gene.</hi> 3.</note> intiſing, concupiſcenſe conceiued: and hauing concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it brought forth ſinne in her: euen the verie taſting and eating of the fruite it ſelfe, which was forbidden. <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:19545:59"/> enticeth and tempteth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> luſt in vs bringeth forth ſinne. The firſt fruites and birth of luſt in men is ſinne: for when luſt and concupiſcenſe hath conceiued, when time, place opportunitie ſerueth: it alſo bringeth forth ſinne.</p>
               <p>That the Apoſtle here ſaith: Luſt when it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, bringeth foorth ſinne: thereupon our aduerſaries the Papiſts take an occaſion to broch this their opinion concerning concupiſcenſe, that it is no ſinne: for thus they conclude, luſt bringeth forth ſinne, therefore luſt is not finne. One thing can not be cauſe and effect too: the effect it ſelfe, and the cauſe of it ſelfe: luſt therefore cannot be ſinne, if it bring forth ſinne. For then ſhould it be cauſe of it ſelf, and bring forth it ſelfe, which is a ſpeach moſt vnproper.</p>
               <p>To this be it anſwered: that one thing may be cauſe and effect alſo, but not cauſe and effect in the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. One thing may be cauſe of ſinne, and yet ſinne: for one ſinne is oftentimes cauſe of another ſinne. Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcenſe and luſt therefore is not onely cauſe of ſinne, but ſinne it ſelfe: yet not the ſame ſinne whereof it is cauſe. Luſt conceiueth and bringeth forth ſinne, that is, an actual ſinne, a ſinne done in deed, ſeene of men, manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant to the view. Such a ſinne is not luſt, but the cauſe of this ſinne: but luſt is a conceiued euill, an inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to euill, and therefore ſinne. Thus luſt is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the cauſe of actuall ſinne, but ſinne it ſelfe: not onelie before baptiſme, but euen after alſo. <note place="margin">Luſt is ſinne.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Which may appeare by reaſons of inuincible ſtrength. Whatſoeuer GOD in his lawe, Chriſt in his Goſpell, the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles and canonized writings, haue forbidden, that is ſinne. God, Chriſt, the Apoſtles, haue forbidden and condemned luſt, therefore it is ſinne.</p>
               <p>That nothing is in Scripture condemned but that which is euill and ſinne, no man of witte, capacitie, or reaſon can denie. That concupiſcenſe and luſt, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it ſelfe is in the Scriptures condemned, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth euidently. Almightie God in the lawe, hauing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19545:59"/> theft, and adultery, and ſuch like ſinnes, when they come into acte: leaſt any ſhould thinke, If theft and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.</note> onely be accounted for ſinnes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when they come into an open action: then peraduenture, to luſt and deſire my neighbours goods, is nothing, ſo that I abſteine from theft: to deſire &amp; luſt after my neighbours wife, is no ſin, ſo that I keep my ſelfe from the acte of adulterie. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent this, God telleth vs that we muſt not onely not vſe our neighbours wife in fleſhly manner, but not luſte after her: We muſt not onely not robbe or ſteale, but not ſo much as deſire the goods of our neighbour: wherefore in the laſt commaundement he vtterly forbiddeth deſire or luſt: Thou ſhalt not luſt after thy neighbors wife, his houſe, his manſeruant, his maidſeruant, his oxe, his aſſe, or any thing that is his. Thereupon our bleſſed Sauiour in the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.</note> Goſpell condemneth not onely for adulterie the vſing of other women beſides our owne wiues, but alſo the very deſiring and luſting after them in our hearts: therefore as the true expoſitor of the lawe of God, corrupted moſt ſhamefully, and horribly depraued by the Scribes &amp; Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies, who condemned outward actions onely for ſinne: he ſaith, I ſay vnto you, whoſoeuer looketh vpon a woman to luſt after her, hath committed adulterie already with her in his heart. The holy Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> diſputing of the effectes of the lawe, hee reckoneth this one, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, that therby wee come to the knowledge <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</note> of ſinne: &amp; condemning there concupiſcenſe for ſinne, ſaith, I knew not that to luſt had been ſinne, if the law had not ſaid, thou ſhalt not luſt. Wherein the Apoſtle not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſeth luſt to be ſin, but to be ſin in the law forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Now leaſt wee ſhoulde thinke that the Apoſtle had ſpoken it vnawares, or that that ſpeach had ſlipt out of his mouth before he wiſt, it is vſuall with him to condemne luſt, and that fountaine of al other ſinne, for ſin. wherefore in the ſixt Chapter at the leaſt fiue times he calleth that corruption which is in man (albeit it raigne not in the Saints by actually committing any thing) by the name <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</note> of ſinne: luſt which is the fountaine of all actuall euill, is
<pb facs="tcp:19545:60"/> in like manner in the next Chapter at the leaſt ſixe times <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> called ſinne. In the eight Chapter about thriſe, the luſt and concupiſcence, the inward affection and inclination <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.</note> to ſinne indeede, is called ſinne. The Authour to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes calleth it ſinne, which hangeth on, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth about.</p>
               <p>Finally, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> reputeth luſt for ſinne, when he <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> exhorteth men to abſteine from fleſhly luſt, not only from groſſe ſinnes actually committed, but euen from corrupt affections, and euill motions of the heart, from whence all actuall ſinne ſpringeth. Seeing then concupiſcence and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.</note> luſt is forbidden and condemned, both in the law, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the Goſpell: how may any man denie it to bee finne?</p>
               <p n="2">2 Againe, Whatſoeuer is repugnant to the lawe of God, and his will, is ſinne: Luſt and concupiſcence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the law and will of God: it is ſinne therefore. Sinne is a rebellion and repugnancie to the will of God, and a tranſgreſſing of his commaundements: wherefore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle defining ſinne, ſaith: Sinne is the tranſgreſſion of the law: but luſt and concupiſcence, not <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.</note> onely in the wicked, but in the regenerate, oppoſeth it ſelfe to the law of God, and draweth men into the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of his will: which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, when hee crieth out, that he ſaw a law in his members, repugning <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</note> and withſtanding the law of his minde, and leading him captiue vnto ſinne. And that by the law of his minde, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which, luſt being the law of his members fighteth: the law of God is vnderſtood, he ſheweth in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I my ſelfe in my minde ſerue the law of God, but in my fleſh the law of ſinne.</p>
               <p>In which place, what before he called the lawe of his minde, here he calleth the law of God: and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the law of his members, here he calleth the lawe of ſinne.</p>
               <p>If the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> luſt and concupiſcence, euen in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, be contrarie, and rebellious vnto the lawe of God,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19545:60"/> then muſt it needes be euill, and ſinne: For whatſoeuer is contrarie to Gods law, is ſinne.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Moreouer, concupiſcence is from the fleſh, and not from the ſpirite. That which commeth from the fleſh is altogether euill, not good: therefore luſt proceeding from the fleſhly part of man, is euill and ſinne, not pure and good. The fleſh, and whatſoeuer is thereof, is nothing els but euill and ſinne, euer ſtriuing, euer ſtrugling againſt the Spirite. Wherefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, I knowe that in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.</note> me, that is, in my fleſh, dwelleth no good. Who ſetting downe the conflict and ſtriuing of the fleſh and Spirite, affirmeth that the fleſh coueteth and luſteth againſt the Spirite, and the Spirite againſt the fleſh: ſo that the very Saints of God cannot doe the thinges which they woulde doe.</p>
               <p>In the ſame place a little after, diſcouering and deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 9.</note> the works of the fleſh, he reckoneth vp nothing that thereof commeth, but ſinne and wickednes: The workes (ſaith he) of the fleſh are manifeſt: which are whordome, enuie, idolatrie, wantonnes, vncleannes, crafte, debate, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, &amp;c. There is then in the fleſh nothing but ſin: nothing but rebelling againſt the Spirite: nothing but euil and iniquitie. Luſt therefore being from the fleſh, cannot be but fleſhly. For all that is borne of the fleſh, is fleſhly, as ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt in the Goſpell. Hereupon then it <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.</note> muſt needes follow, as a reſolute concluſion, that ſeeing luſt is from the fleſh, therefore it is ſinne.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Finally, euen this place conuinceth luſte and concupiſcence to be euill. For whatſoeuer is the proper cauſe and prouoker vnto ſinne, that ſame is euill and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: But euery ſinne proceedeth from the luſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence of the heart, from the euill motions, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections in men: which if they be not ſtayed, euen in the Saintes of God, but let raigne in our mortall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: then forthwith, as time, place, and other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will ſuffer, they bring foorth the very ſinne in acte, whereof the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh: Luſt when it hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:61"/> bringeth foorth ſinne. Seeing all ſinne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes among men, procedeth from luſt, it cannot be but it muſt bee euill: for an euill tree cannot bring foorth good fruite, nor a good tree euil fruite; but as is the fruite, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.</note> ſuch is the tree: as is the effect, ſuch is the cauſe: as is the birth, ſuch is the conception: as ſinne is in nature, ſuch is luſt and concupiſcence from which it proceedeth. For it is the euill motion and affection of the heart, it is the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thought that riſeth in our mindes, it is concupiſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and luſt in our members, which kindleth the flaming fire of all vngodlines, and pricketh and tickleth the hearts of men, to entiſe them to ſinne.</p>
               <p>Concupiſcence and luſt therefore is not onely the cauſe of ſinne, but euil and ſinne it ſelfe. The fathers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſubſcribe. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> calleth it iniquitie, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that there is a certaine delectation, pleaſure, or deſire in man, repugnant to the will of God, of which ſaith he, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, I ſee a law in my members reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</note> the law of my minde. Saint <hi>Hillarie</hi> calleth the euils which are in vs, maliciouſnes, by reaſon of the condition of originall ſinne. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, that thoſe firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whereby men are ſolicited and moued, be ſuch as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vpon Mat. chap.</hi> 7.</note> want not fault. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in many places calleth the naturall luſt which is in men, which I call concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, remayning euen in the regenerate, by the name of euill; and how it is euill he expoundeth againſt <hi>Iulian.</hi> In the ſame worke he ſaith, that luſt is not only the euill of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Contra Iul. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> puniſhment, but of fault alſo.</p>
               <p>Finally he ſaith, it is a vice, againſt which wee muſt ſtriue by vertue. Wherefore, if either in holy Scripture, (as we neuer doe directly, but by conſequent as here) wee heare concupiſcence is cauſe of ſinne, therefore not ſinne; or in the fathers, as in Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who in ſome places calleth not this naturall corruption remaining in the Saintes, by the name of ſinne, but diſputeth the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <note place="margin">13.</note> that it is not ſinne in them: Wee muſt diſtinguiſh of ſinne, there is ſinne raigning, there is ſinne dwelling in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19545:61"/> men, it is not ſinne reigning, but it is ſinne dwelling in our mortall bodies. There is ſinne mortall, and ſinne ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall; it is not ſinne mortall, but veniall, becauſe in the Saints it is not imputed. There is ſinne actuall, there is finne in heart and will not effected nor done: it is not ſin actuall, but it is ſinne in heart conceiued and conſented vnto, which before God is ſinne.</p>
               <p>When Saint <hi>Iames</hi> here ſaith, Luſt when it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued bringeth foorth ſinne, he ſpeaketh of ſinne after the phraſe of Scripture commonly vſed, taking ſinne for ſinne committed, ſinne actuall: not denying, either the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting vnto ſinne, which is the conception of luſt, neither luſt it ſelfe, which is (as it were) the ſeede, the ſountain, the matter of miſchiefe, to be ſinnes in their kindes: albeit not actuall and committed, being as yet ſuppreſſed and kept downe in the heart and will of man.</p>
               <p>Neither doeth <hi>Iames</hi> here curiouſly diſpute when ſin is in it ſelfe and before God: when it firſt ſpringeth and beginneth in the account and iudgement of God: but he ſpeaketh of ſinne, as it is knowen to be ſinne before men. Sinne conceaued in heart, before God is ſinne: All euill motions, cogitations, affections of the minde, by God are condemned as ſinnes: but actions and deedes done, are knowen onely to men, who pearce not into the heart or cogitation. Wherefore when a thing is in acte, then onely with men it is accounted. Seeing then that ſinne is not ſeene and knowen for ſinne with men, but then when it is in acte, and done, or doing, which is actuall ſinne: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in this ſenſe ſpeaking of ſinne, ſaith: Luſt, when it hath conceaued, bringeth foorth ſinne. Wherence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, that becauſe luſt bringeth foorth ſinne, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not ſinne: For albeit it be not ſeen for ſinne with men (who iudge onely by the action of men) yet is it ſinne <note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 16.</note> with God, who knoweth the very heart, and firſt motions. Albeit it be not reigning ſinne, yet is it ſinne dwelling; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it be not mortall ſinne in the Saints, yet is it veniall ſinne in them alſo, waſhed away, and cleanſed by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19545:62"/>
               <p> The firſt birth, and firſt fruite of luſt, to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and brought into act, is ſinne: wherof S. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, Luſt when it hath conceaued, bringeth foorth ſinne.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde and latter birth of luſt is death: For luſt bringeth foorth ſinne, and ſinne bringeth foorth death: death riſeth and groweth out of ſinne, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. 1. <hi>Peter.</hi> 2.</note> and committed: ſinne being finiſhed, bringeth forth death.</p>
               <p>Sinne is then ſaid to be finiſhed or made perfect, when we geue conſent to it, when we yealde our ſelues thereunto, when we ſuffer it to rule and raigne ouer vs, as bearing chiefe ſway and ſwindge in our life. Sinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> thus perfected, bringeth foorth death. Wherein he ſheweth what effect followeth the carnall life of man, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable vnto that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> The wages or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of ſinne is death: but eternall life is the gift of God through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. And not long after, If ye walke after the fleſh, ye ſhall die: in as much as ſinne brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth foorth, and purchaſeth death vnto men. This may appeare manifeſt by one onely example, <hi>Iudas</hi> the traitor was firſt tempted by couetous motions: this temptation <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 18.</note> he withſtoode not, but conſented, and followed the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo was drawen away from duetie to Chriſt by his deſire: ſo luſt conceaued: luſt hauing now conſent of his will, broake foorth into treaſon, and ſo ſinne was brought foorth, euen the ſinne of treaſon, whereby Chriſt was ſold and betrayed to the people, and prieſtes of the Iewes. This treaſon committed, and ſinne perfected, purchaſed death: for thereby he procured, and purchaſed vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, eternall deſtruction, which followeth ſinne, as the hire, the labour: the wages, the trauell: the crowne, the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Acts</hi> 18.</note> workes of men. Men therefore being tempted and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their owne luſt to committe ſinne, by committing of ſinne procure death, becauſe ſinne being done indeede, bringeth foorth death.</p>
               <p>Death is due to euery ſinne which men committe, ſo that no ſinne committed, conſidered in it ſelfe, is ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but deſerueth death. But ſeeing the ſinnes of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19545:62"/> Saints are waſhed away by the fountaine of regeneration through faith in Chriſt, therefore their ſinnes which through infirmitie they committe, to them procure not death, as they do to the wicked. But the ſinnefull liues of men, who tempted to euil by their owne luſte and deſires, and caried away therby to commit ſinne; procure to them death, according to the doctrine of the Apoſtle, ſinne whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is finiſhed bringeth forth death.

Doe not ſo groſſely and grieuouſly erre, my brethren: as to impute the cauſe of theſe thinges to GOD: this errour is greate, blaſphemous, and wicked: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware therefore you thinke not ſo of God, as that he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciteth or mooueth any to euill: Erre not my deare brethren.</p>
               <p>The concluſion thus interlaced with the reaſons: <note place="margin">3. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </note> the third and laſt reaſon why men may not ſay when they are tempted, they are tempted of God, is from contrarie effects, and things repugnant: to be authour of good and euill, are things repugnant: God is authour of good, therefore he can not bee authour of euill temptations: euerie good gift, and euerie perfect gift is from aboue, and commeth downe from the father of lights, with whom is no variableneſſe, neither ſhadow of turning. If God therfore be the cauſe of all good things, then can he not be cauſe of euill things alſo: not of euill temptations therfore, whereby we are ſolicited to wickednes. Nothing
<pb facs="tcp:19545:64"/> can be cauſe truly and properly, of contrarie effects: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, the cauſe, authour and worker of all good gifts in men, may not bee ſaide to bee cauſe of euill tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Of this reaſon the former part or antecedent is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet downe: Euerie good giuing, and euerie perfect gift commeth from aboue, from the father of lights, &amp;c. wherby the Apoſtle teacheth vs, that god is the fountaine of all goodneſſe, the giuer of all good gifts, the authour of all good things in men: he is the bottomleſſe pit of all grace, that cannot be emptied or drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drie of vs: he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth whatſoeuer is good in the whole world: Herehence Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calleth him the God of all grace, becauſe all <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.</note> grace and all good gifts come onely from him, as from a well head and fountaine. The God of all grace, who hath called vs vnto his eternall glorie by Ieſus Chriſt, after that you haue ſuffered a little, make you perfect, ſtrengthen and ſtabliſh you. S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> being tolde of the Iewes, that Chriſt baptiſed, and all men came vnto him, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.</note> the graces which were in Chriſt to come from heauen, from God, as a fountaine of al goodnes: anſwered and ſaid vnto them: a man can do nothing except it be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him from aboue: this is anſwerable to this Apoſtles doctrine: Euerie good giuing, and euery perfect gift is from aboue, from the father of lights. All the effects of Gods will are onely good: and whatſoeuer vertue, grace, good gift is, it is from God. Seeing therefore all good things come from him, he being the onely authour of all goodneſſe and graces in the children of men: we ought not to make him the cauſe of our temptations, whereby we are moued to euill: for then ſhould he bee cauſe, not only of diuers, but of contrarie effects, which he properly cannot be. And thus is his reaſon plaine and euident.</p>
               <p>In this place almightie God is adorned and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with three ornaments, wherein his excellent good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe more appeareth.</p>
               <p n="1">1 He is called the father of lights, the fountaine and well-ſpring, the authour and cauſe from whence all
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19545:64"/> good giftes flowe and ſpring vnto men. For this cauſe is God called, not onely the father of lights, but (as pure, innocent, holy, righteous, good, and the authour of all goodneſſe) he is alſo called light. So is God called the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai.</hi> 60.</note> euerlaſting light of his Church, becauſe all graces and giftes wherewith the Church is beautified, come from God, as from a fountaine and father of vertues. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>John</hi> recordeth of God, that hee is light, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.</note> and in him is no darkeneſſe: the fountaine of all vertue, the giuer of all grace, a nature moſt perfect and iuſt: farre from all contagion or mixture of ſinne: the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of good, but not of any euill: this the Apoſtle in theſe wordes expreſſing, calleth GOD the father of lightes. By lights hee vnderſtandeth vertues, graces, good things: as by darkeneſſe the contrarie is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, by the phraiſe of the Hebrues. If then God be the father, fountaine, and authour of lightes, vertues, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and good things in men: then may it not be ſaid that he is cauſe of euill temptations, for that agreeth not to light, but to darkeneſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Moreouer, it is attributed vnto God, that hee is not variable, mutable, chaungeable, with whom there is, ſayeth <hi>Iames:</hi> no variableneſſe. This is added to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent that which otherwiſe might haue beene obiected: they might ſay, God in deede is ſometimes the cauſe of good things among men: it followeth not therefore, but that he may be ſometimes in like maner the cauſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. Men excelling in vertue, and cauſes of good things in common wealthes, may ſometimes change their good into euill: and ſometimes do one thing, &amp; ſometimes the other: and why may not God ſo do? the Apoſtle ſheweth; God is not variable, there is no changing with him: he is conſtant, alwayes alike, euer cauſe of good, neuer author of euil. Whereof euen <hi>Balaam</hi> the couetous prophet hath <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 23.</note> truely prophecied to <hi>Balac</hi> the King of Moab: GOD is not as man, that hee ſhould lie, nor as the ſonne of man, that he ſhould repent: Seeing then hee had once bleſſed his people Iſrael: hee beeing alwayes
<pb facs="tcp:19545:65"/> like himſelfe, will not varie or chaunge his purpoſe. The <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 34.</note> princely Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> remouing all variableneſſe from God, and making him conſtant, and euer like himſelfe, affirmeth, that albeit heauen and earth periſh, &amp; be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged like a garment, yet he remaineth the ſame, and his yeares faile not. This <hi>Samuel</hi> told <hi>Saul</hi> the king of Iſrael, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings</hi> 15.</note> that ſeeing he had giuen the kingdome from him to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> therefore that purpoſe ſhoulde ſtande, becauſe the ſtrength of Iſrael will not lie, nor repent: for he is not a man that he ſhould repent. God is like himſelfe in all things, with whom there is no variableneſſe. VVhen God altereth things at his owne pleaſure, ſaith Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> the things alter, but he remaineth the ſame, and chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 20. 25. <hi>on Iob.</hi>
                  </note> not. Therefore by his Prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> he crieth, I am the Lord, I chaunge not: and your ſonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Malac.</hi> 3.</note> are not conſumed. VVhen then in Scripture it is ſaide often, it repented God, the Scripture ſpeaketh to the capacitie of men, but in no wiſe attributeth inconſtancie and variableneſſe to God. This doe thoſe manifolde places teach, which witneſſe that GOD is ſure, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, and conſtant in all his wayes. If therefore GOD varie not, then hee being once the authour of good things, hee alwayes doeth good, not euill, and is the fountaine of good giftes, not cauſe of euill temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to any.</p>
               <p n="3">3 As God chaungeth not, ſo there is no ſhadowe of turning with him. He is not like the Sunne, the Moone, the Starres, which appeare and ſhine ſometimes, but at other times are couered with darkeneſſe, which haue their chaunges and their courſes: the day nowe, within ten, eleuen, or twelue houres, the night: the Sunne glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous now in beautie: but anon in an Eclipſe: the Moone nowe in the full, nowe in the waine, now newe, nowe a quarter olde, and ſo forth. The Planets nowe in this place of heauen, nowe in that, ſhining. There is no ſuch turning with God. He is not now good, and nowe turned to the contrarie: for hee is alwayes light, and with him is no <note place="margin">1. <hi>Jhon</hi> 1.</note> darkeneſſe at all. For his goodneſſe is alwayes cleare,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19545:65"/> bright, and continually ſhining: his light chaungeth not with Sunne, Moone, or Starres in the Firmament: he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not good things at one time, and at another draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs to euill by any temptation: but as himſelfe is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, ſo are his graces and giftes alwayes good, and not chaungeable into euill: wherefore hee is not to bee counted authour of euill in any wiſe, as by the wicked he is wrongfully charged: neither ſendeth hee euill at any time to men, whereof they themſelues are not the firſt cauſes: he excelleth not now in vertue, and anon falleth into infirmitie: he is not now the authour of good things, and anon turneth to the contrarie: but hee is in deede that God of grace and goodneſſe, that fountaine and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights, with whom there is no variableneſſe, nor ſhadowe of chaunging: wherefore the worker of good things, but not the prouoker of man vnto wickedneſſe by any euill temptation: which is the thirde thing here at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto God, that with him there is no ſhadow of turning: and this is the thirde reaſon why men beeing tempted, ought not to ſay, they are tempted of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the authour of good, and therefore cannot be authour of euill, for that he cannot be cauſe of contrarie effects: And thus entreating of the goodneſſe of God, as the fountaine of al grace in man, and ſhewing by theſe reaſons that God cannot be counted the authour of our euill: or the cauſe of euill temptations in vs, he diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the worke of regeneration, as the moſt manifeſt token and teſtimonie of his goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>For the greatneſſe therefore of his goodneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the children of men, and for his manifold graces, let vs dayly pray vnto him, that he may ſhrowde vs vnder his mercifull ſhield of protection and defence, that thereby we being armed, may be able to withſtande all aſſaultes and temptations of Satan, the worlde, and our owne concupiſcence; that we may ſtand faſt in the day of our triall, and with inuincible fortitude and pacience, may finiſh our wearifull pilgrimage in his feare, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſeruice, to the glorie of his name, the profite of

               <p>Touching the former of theſe, the excellencie of the worde of God it ſelfe in ſpeciall, thereunto he diſcendeth by the former treatiſe. Wherein diſputing of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God, he here ſheweth, that his goodnes eſpecially appeareth in the worke of our regeneration: the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cauſe whereof is the worde of God, whereof in this place he ſpeaketh. So then in this 18. verſe, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle giueth vs, as it were, a taſte of that which in generall he had ſpoken, that God is the fountaine of all goodnes: which as in ſundrie other things appeareth: ſo eſpecially in the worke of our regeneration, the moſt expreſſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of his goodneſſe towardes vs: which being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant and manifeſt, wee muſt needes confeſſe, that all good giuings, and all good giftes come from him: ſo that wee can not ſay, without blaſphemie, nor thinke without impietie, that GOD is authour or cauſe of our euill temptations: and in as much as GOD both firſt created man in perfect innocencie, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde regenerated him to bee like the image of his owne ſonne in excellent vertue: his great goodneſſe doeth ſo appeare to all men, that it were incomparable iniquitie in any wiſe to make him cauſe of our wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>To come therefore to the excellencie of the worde, which is the meane of our regeneration, the Apoſtle ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe the other cauſes thereof alſo: ſo that in

               <p n="2">2 The efficient cauſe of our regeneration, is the free will of God: Of his owne will, ſayth <hi>Iames,</hi> begate he vs. The good will of God, the gracious fauour and free pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God, is the firſt and efficient cauſe of ſaluation and regeneration in men: to the trueth whereof, all the Scriptures of GOD beare witneſſe. The electing, preferring and aduauncing the Iewes aboue all other people, beeing as it were a figure and reſemblaunce of the eternall election, and regeneration of the Saints: was not for any merite of man, but of the onely mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and loue of GOD towardes them, as <hi>Moiſes</hi> witneſſed.

Whereunto that is agreeable in another place: all haue ſinned, and are depriued of the glorie of God: and are iuſtified freely by his grace, through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</note> that is in Chriſt Ieſus. Thus of his owne will, and freely hee electeth: thus of his owne goodneſſe hee iuſtifieth: thus of his meere mercie hee regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs vnto life.</p>
               <p>The holy Apoſtle noting this cauſe of all theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull workes of God in man, affirmeth that God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <note place="margin">

Thou foundeſt nothing in vs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">

This our bleſſed Sauiour to expreſſe, telleth his Diſciples that hee choſe them, not they him, becauſe there was nothing in them wherefore he ſhould chooſe them, yet of his owne free wil he choſe them.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>John</hi> ſubſcribeth hereunto, in that hee ſaith, <note place="margin">1. <hi>John</hi> 4.</note> Herein is loue, not that we loued him, but that he loued vs firſt, and gaue his ſonne to be a reconciliation for our ſinnes.

               <p>Thus his free will and fauour towardes man, is the onely efficiencie, as of al other his vnſpeakeable graces, ſo of regeneration in his children. That therefore (ſaith <hi>Beda)</hi> which he ſaid before, that euery good geuing, and ouery perfect gift commeth from aboue from the father <note place="margin">S.

               <p>In this place therefore, not only plainly Saint <hi>Iames,</hi>

For if regeneration be through the free will of God, if predeſtination, election, iuſtification and ſanctification, be from the mercie and fauour of God, as from the firſt and efficient cauſe, then are none of all theſe by-workes or deſerts of men: for there is a playne contrarietie betwixt fauour and merite, grace and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: ſo that <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoneth from the oppoſition thereof, againſt workes, in the matter of iuſtification: To him that worketh, the wages is not counted of fauour, but of debt. <note place="margin">

               <p>If the goſpell of Chriſt be the word of trueth, why

               <p>If the goſpell be the word of trueth, whereby we are regenerate, and borne againe, why are men and women ſo daintie and coy, why are they ſo choiſe hereof, that they wil heare it onely, when, where, and of whom they luſte? as if the men make it the word of trueth, and the inſtrument of our regeneration? Let not men and women pretend that they are ſanctified men and women: let them not vaunte themſelues to be purer then their brethren, and heare this word with this partialitie. For I proteſt vnto euery ſuch, in the feare of God, that vnleſſe this word of trueth, and inſtrument of regeneration, be ſweeter vnto them then the hony, and the hony combe: by what meſſenger ſoeuer the Lord doeth ſend it: that they flatter and deceiue them ſelues in a vaine ſhadowe of holines, and are not truely ſanctified vnto the Lord, neither haue effectually taſted of the doctrine of regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherof this word is the mean and inſtrument.</p>

               <p n="1">1 Concerning the firſt, thus ſayth Saint <hi>James:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my brethren, let euery man be ſwift to heare, but flow to ſpeake. Wherein our vaine babling, and fooliſh talking when we ſhould heare, is condemned: and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; audience to the word commanded vnto the ſaints: that we ſhew our ſelues prompt and readie to learne, and not haſtie to teach others, when we ſhould heare and learn our ſelues rather. Thus is our raſhnes which are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, reproued, when we talke of high &amp; heauenly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, too excellent and deepe for our ſlender capacitie: As of the nature &amp; ſecret wiſdome of God, of his inſcrutible iudgement in calling and chooſing ſome: and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning other at his free pleaſure, and ſuch like: wherein we muſt ſtay our ſelues, contented therein to bee informed with pacience and ſilence of ſuch as are learned.</p>
               <p>The heathen Philoſophers, would not men raſhly to <note place="margin">Pythagoras.</note> ſpeake, but rather to heare with ſilence: for which cauſe noble <hi>Pythagoras</hi> inioyned his hearers vij. yeares ſilence, that that while they might learne, but not raſhly talke of the precepts of philoſophie. Was that needfull in humain philoſophie, and is it not much more needfull in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly philoſophie of God, that we be ſwift to heare, and ſlow to ſpeake, of the diuine miſteries of his word? And <hi>Cleobulus</hi> taught, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be more careful to heare <note place="margin">Cleobulus.</note> then to ſpeake: becauſe audience and attentiue hearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:19545:73"/> more becommeth moſt men, then to ſpeake. When <hi>Zeno</hi> heard a yong man prating, and ſpeaking much, mocking <note place="margin">Zeno.</note> him, hee tolde him that his eares were growne in to his tongue, becauſe he heard little, and ſpoke much: where he ſhould haue heard much, and ſpoken little. Nature it ſelfe would haue vs ſwift to heare, but ſlow to ſpeake, for which cauſe we haue two eares giuen vs, to heare much, and but one tongue, to ſpeake little.</p>
               <p>When men therefore haue not the ſufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things, they ought rather to heare in ſilence, and learne with pacience, then raſhly to ſpeake of the things they knowe not. A thing no doubt, not onely needfull in worldly wiſedome, but neceſſarie alſo in heauenlie philoſophie. <hi>Sirach</hi> wiſheth men to bee ſwift to heare good things, and to be of pure life; but to giue anſwere <note place="margin">

And if they haue vnderſtanding, to ſhape an anſwere vnto their neighbour: if not, to lay their handes vpon their mouthes, leaſt they be trapped in an vndiſcrete worde, and ſo bee blamed. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> ſeeing raſh babling to bee a diſturbance vnto the attention of men, which they ought to performe to the worde, exhorteth men to be ſwift to heare, but ſlowe to ſpeake.</p>
               <p>That wee are willed to bee ſwift, quicke, readie and prompt to heare and learne, but ſlowe to ſpeake: it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth not men to ſpeake at all; but not to ſpeake raſhly: but to obſerue time, place, perſon, and other circumſtaunces in their ſpeach, as ſhall be moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
               <p>And the circumſtaunces in our talke and ſpeaking to be obſerued, are ſpecially theſe. 1 The perſon to whom, 2 The place where. 3 The time when. 4 The maner how. 5 The things whereof wee ſpeake. 6 The ende wherefore: which carefully obſerued, greatly beautifie and adorne the talke and ſpeach of men.</p>

It was reckned for great ſinne in the people for hating the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which reptoued them openly in their aſſemblies; <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach</hi> condemneth it with <hi>Salomon</hi> among the follies and fooleries of men, to hate inſtruction, and diſdaine to be <note place="margin">

And the Apoſtle here forbiddeth anger and wrath to be wreaked againſt them, which informe and teach vs wiſedom. Thus then to hate the inſtructor: to ſpeake againſt the teacher and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; to perſecute them which rebuke ſinne and iniquitie among men; to diſdaine to be taught and inſtructed; to be angrie with thoſe by whom our ſinnes are condemned, our enormities reformed, our erours reclaimed; is not o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly great infirmitie; but malitious wickednes, and deue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh folly which thing (as an hinderance vnto knowledge in the word of truth, an impediment to our new birth and regeneration in Chriſt; rebellious and wickedly oppoſed vnto God himſelfe, who by the word calleth vs to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) the Apoſtl here condemneth and remoueth; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my deare brethren, Let euery man be ſwifte to heare, but ſlowe to ſpeake and ſlowe to wrath.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:19545:76"/>
               <p> Of this latter, there is a reaſon here rendred, why men ſhould not be angrie when they are reproued, and taught in the word: becauſe that that anger worketh not the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of God. A reaſon from diſprofit, from diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: This wrath and anger herence conceiued, worketh not the righteouſnes of God, yea it hindreth Gods worke in vs: in that the audience and hearing of the word is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. It worketh not that which is righteous before god, &amp; which of his ſeruants he requireth, namely, to heare his word with reuerence, to do his wil with carefulnes, and be fruitfull in all good workes to his glory. This anger, wrath, &amp; geuing place to diſordered affections, &amp; tumults of our minds, worketh not the righteouſnes of God. Yea, where this is, there godly righteouſnes, chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dutifulnes and holy obedience to the word, is exiled, abandoned, abo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liſhed, &amp; clean eſtranged from among vs: there the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of God ruleth not, neither is that moderation and godly atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which before was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that we ſhould be ſwift to heare, but ſlowe to ſpeake, in any meaſure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: yea rather ſinne is ſuffered to haue his ſouerainty in vs: for as patient &amp; godly reuerence hath all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues tied as in an indiſſoluble &amp; inſeperable chaine: ſo al impietie al vngodlines &amp; vnrighteouſnes of men, ruleth &amp; raigneth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> impatience &amp; wrath diſquieteth vs. This reaſon ought to moue men to put away al ſwelling, al an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger &amp; wrath from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and without choler, ſnuffing, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine: to heare gods word inſtructing them, that they may be begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe by god, with the word of truth, to be the firſt fruits of his creatures. Now let vs pray vnto God, who of his own wil hath begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs with the word of truth, that we ſhould be the firſt fruites of his creatures: that we may be ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthned with the grace of his holy ſpirite in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, to heare with redines, to ſpeak of his word with ſobernes, &amp; to keep it with carefulnes: that in happy iſſue of our waies, we may be bleſſed with ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt our Sauiour: To whom, with the father &amp; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, the moſt heauenly comforter, be praiſe, glory, honor, and maieſtie, now and for euer, Amen.</p>

               <p>But becauſe in all ages and times, many do heare, yet neuer the nearer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wee are not only taught to heare, <note place="margin">2 <hi>The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>

For if it be to ſome the ſauour of life, vnto life; but to others the ſauour of death, vnto death; if the worde ſound in the eares of many, to their iuſter condemnation; then is it not enough to knowe we muſt heare, but alſo to learne how to heare, is neceſarie: for which cauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.</note> teacheth vs how we ought to heare &amp; receaue this word of trueth, whereby God of his owne good will, hath begotten vs againe to be the firſt fruites of his creatures.</p>
               <p>In the manner of our hearing and receauing this word, the Apoſtle firſt remoueth certaine euils from vs, which hinder our profitable hearing: then hee ſheweth poſitiuely and affirmatiuely, how we muſt heare.</p>
               <p>Touching the former, he willeth in hearing to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all filthines and ſuperfluitie of maliciouſnes: all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, all carnall affection, all loſenes of life; all pride and inſolencie of minde; all arrogancie and diſdainefulnes of ſpirite: wherence, wrath, anger, debate, contention often ariſeth, and the fructifieng of the worde is alwaies hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: all which muſt be abandoned, and aboliſhed vtterly from them, which wil profitably heare the word of trueth. Filthines, and corruption of heare or affection, is, wherby our mindes doe wander, and we are occupied about other matters, thinking of our pride, pleaſures, vanitie, and ſuch like, when our mindes ſhould be ſtayed and fixed in the hearing of the word. Superfluitie of maliciouſnes is, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we growe into contempt of the word, ſpeaking euil and diſdainfully of the diuine doctrine, and heauenly wiſdom of God, which two muſt firſt be remoued. For whereas mens mindes are a wool-gathering, and caried away with filthy cogitations and deſires: there men cannot heare the worde with profit: and when men growe in diſlike of the worde, hate of the trueth, ſpeake euill of the myſterie of godlines, what commoditie can it then bring to ſuch, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19545:79"/> what hope is there, that in them it ſhall fructifie? This Saint <hi>Iames</hi> verie well perceyued, therefore hee remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth theſe euils from godly hearers: This ſhall all men by their owne experience moſt eaſily learne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt carefully remooue them. Whereof to ſpeake no more but this: howe is it that many men often heare, and learne nothing: yea, being asked what hath beene ſayde, remember nothing: but that, when they ſhould heare, their mindes are either ſet vppon couetous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, or occupied about fleſhly imaginations, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with proude conceytes, or rauiſhed with filthie cogitations: or elſe alienated by miſlike, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and contempt, from the worde preached: ſo that ſounded in the eare, it pearceth not our hearts, and ſo is fruitleſſe in vs? The firſt hereof, is in carnall profeſſours, who in worde and ſhewe pretend religion, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</note> but in deede denie it, as did ſome euen in the time of the Apoſtles. The other is true in malicious and obſtinate Papiſts, who comming with a preiudicate opinion, and conceyued hatred and diſlike of the worde: and in parciall hearers, who therein haue reſpect of perſons, and are not indifferent: ſo that by hearing, neither is profited. Seeing then filthie cogitations, and carnall affections ſpoyle men: and ſuperfluitie of maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe bereaue men of the fruite of the worde: VVho ſo will, to the comfort of his ſoule, the diſcharge of a good conſcience, with reuerence to God, and benefite to himſelfe here, muſt firſt remoue all filthineſſe, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie of maliciouſneſſe farre from him: as by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle he is exhorted.</p>
               <p>Filthineſſe and ſuperfluitie of maliciouſneſſe, put and laid apart, we muſt heare and receyue with meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the worde that is graffed in vs, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde thing in the manner of our hearing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
               <p>This meekneſſe, is the promptneſſe and ready deſire of our mindes to learne: that Chriſtian docilitie and tractableneſſe, whereby we are content without pride,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:80"/> arrogancie, contempt or obſtinacie, to yeeld themſelues to be informed and taught by God, and his miniſters, in the worde. A vertue moſt excellent: a grace moſt ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: an ornament moſt beautifull in the liues of Gods Saints: ſo highly accounted of with almightie God, that by his Prophet he proteſteth, that he will looke vnto, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.</note> haue regarde to thoſe that are of a meeke and contrite heart, and ſuch as tremble at his worde. Theſe are the meeke ſpirited commended of God, who in humilitie and pureneſſe of heart, receyue with readineſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence the worde of God, and the doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel when it is preached. The people of Iſrael herein were <note place="margin">

For their like meekneſſe in hearing the word, after their returne from captiuitie, by <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> they are commended, for that from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.</note> to night, they hearkened to the worde read and expounded vnto them. <hi>Joſiah</hi> was in this poynt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular meekeneſſe towardes the worde: who hearing the lawe read, humbled himſelfe, and his heart thereat melted: wherefore the plagues therein threatned, fell <note place="margin">2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.</note> not vpon the people in his dayes, but after he was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to his fathers. Farre otherwiſe was it in the dayes of <hi>Jeremie</hi> the Prophet, in <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the King: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ierem.</hi> 36.</note> who receyued not the worde by the Prophet ſent, with meekeneſſe: but contemptuouſly, rebelliouſly, obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed it, and cauſed the roll wherein it was written, in the fire to be conſumed.</p>
               <p>This meekenes ſhined in perfect beautie in the Saints <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 13.</note> of God in the Citie of Antioch, in Piſidia, who hearing <hi>Paul</hi> preaching the worde, with all readineſſe receyued it: beſeeching him to preach the ſame vnto them the next Sabboth: whereunto the whole citie at the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 17.</note> was aſſembled. No leſſe meekneſſe was in the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who hearing <hi>Paul</hi> willingly, diſputing of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection

What ſhould we rehearſe and report vnto you, the meek hearing of thoſe of Troas, who with all meekeneſſe and promptneſſe of mind, heard the Apoſtle preach till midnight? O zeale of Gods ſaints? O meekeneſſe of hearing? Vnlike wherunto, are our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this flouriſhing time of the Goſpel: who are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with one houres exerciſing in preaching: which time ſeemeth ſo long to their heauie and dull eares: that they ſpende moſt part thereof, either like drowſie heades, in ſleeping: or like careleſſe perſons, in talking: or like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull men, in reading other things in the meane time: as if the worde preached, pertained not to them: or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie themſelues in other matters, becauſe they ſeeme wiſe enough alreadie, &amp; will not be thought to learne of any other. Or like proude perſons, we diſdaine &amp; thinke ſcorne to be informed: or we will heare whom we liſt: and whom we liſt, we will not: or we will heare to carpe, to catch, to cauill, to finde fault both with the doctour, and with his doctrine. Is this the meeknes of our hearing in the bright ſhining light of the Goſpel? Doth ſuch pride of heart, doth ſuch corruption of affections, doth ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie of maliciouſnes ſo mightily raigne in vs: that after ſo many yeares learning, ſo long time of preaching, ſo great trauell &amp; labor, vpon vs in teaching conſumed: we haue not learned with meeknes to heare the worde prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched? <note place="margin">

               <p>With which maner affection, if we come not to the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</note> preaching of the word, in vaine may <hi>Paul</hi> plant, or <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> water: in vaine ſhall the preacher preach vnto vs, as we ſee dayly: for albeit men and women are ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued for their euil and curſed couetouſnes, their fleſhly

               <p>This word which we ought to receiue with meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is ſaid to be ingraffed in vs: becauſe by Gods ſpirit moouing and inclining our hearts, and by the painfull and dayly labour of his workemen in his heauenly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, which are his miniſters, it is, as it were, inſerted, and taketh roote in our harts. For as ſlippes and twigges of other trees being ingraffed, bound togither, wrapped about with clay, and moſſe, or ſome other thing, by long continuance grow and cleaue inſeparably to the ſtockes whereinto they are graffed: ſo the worde of God by the ſappe of his ſpirit, and by the labour of the miniſters, being, as it were, ingraffed in our hearts: therein often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taketh it ſuch roote in that fruitfull ground, that it is ſaid to be graffed in vs.</p>

                  </note> reaſon is rendered, becauſe it is able to ſaue our ſoules. The vvorde of God is the onely medicine for all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard maladies: it is that ſouereigne ſalue, vvhich ſaueth our ſoules: it is the plaiſter to lay to the vvoundes of of our ſinnes, yea and hath in ſtore a ſalue for euerie ſore of the minde.

               <p>The vvord of God receyued by faith, ſaueth our ſoules: becauſe it is the meane to bring vs to God, and his ſonne <note place="margin">

               <p>Notvvithſtanding this force is not in the bare and outvvard hearing of the vvord: but in beleeuing the vvord preached to vs, and heard of vs: othervviſe it profiteth nothing.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19545:82"/> adherents: but alſo when in worde it is profeſſed, but in conuerſation of life it is not expreſſed: a thing moſt hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and horrible in the ſight of God: of which contempt moſt profeſſours are now guiltie. Hereby then let them be admoniſhed, and ſo effectually reclaymed. And this is the firſt admonition of the Apoſtle: wherefore lay aſide all filthineſſe, and ſuperfluitie of maliciouſneſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue with meekeneſſe the worde that is graffed in you, which is able to ſaue your ſoules.</p>
               <p>Some men, too much giuen to pleaſe themſelues in <note place="margin">2 <hi>Admonition.</hi>
                  </note> their fooliſh imaginations &amp; conceits, hereupon thinke it enough to heare the worde of God, albeit they doe not thereafter. Which fond perſwaſion to roote out of mens mindes, the Apoſtle ſetteth downe this ſecond admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: wherein is ſhewed, that it becommeth all the Saints of God, ſo to heare the word preached, as that they frame their liues thereafter, and liue according as therein they are taught from God: that their conuerſation be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their profeſſion, and their deedes correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the doctrine wherein they are informed.</p>
               <p>In which admonition, two things come to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. 1 What it is that they are admoniſhed of: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be doers of the word, not herers onely. 2 The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why they ſhould ſo do: which are two, as in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhall be euidently apparant.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The admonition: be ye doers of the worde, not hearers onely. S. <hi>Iames</hi> hauing not in vaine learned in the <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Titus.</hi> 1.</note> beeing abhominable, diſobedient, and to euerie good worke reprobate: and in ſhewe make profeſſion, but in life are nothing anſwerable thereunto: in this place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighing againſt that hypocriſie of men, &amp; condemning

               <p>To do the worde is double. 1 To doe it abſolutely, and perfectly, ſo that both the heart conſent, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">A double do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the worde.</note> life anſwere fully to the law of God in perfect mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. To which doing God in the lawe did promiſe life: for in the law it is ſaid, I haue giuen thee lawes, ſtatutes, and ordinaunces, which if thou doe, thou ſhalt liue in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 18.</note> them. Our Sauiour in the Goſpel, thereunto reſpecting, telleth the fooliſh lawyer, who by doing would obtaine <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 10.</note> life, that if hee would loue God with all his heart, with all his ſoule, with all his ſtrength, with all his thought; <note place="margin">

The Apoſtle ſhewing the Iewes, which ſo much boaſted of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lawe, that they muſt perfecty fulfill the lawe, if thereby they would looke to be ſaued, ſaieth: That not the hearers thereof, but the doers of the lawe ſhall be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified before God. This perfect fulfilling and doing all that the law requireth, is that doing which the law and Goſpell mencioneth, and requireth in them, which by their workes hope to attaine life.</p>
               <p>This no man can poſſibly performe: for what man euer could loue God with a perfect heart, with all his ſoule, with his whole affection, ſtrength and power?

               <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle therefore, calleth it a yoke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, which neither they, neither their fathers could <note place="margin">

                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:19545:83"/> in Piſidia, proteſteth, that by the law wee could not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from our ſinnes, becauſe we could not perfourme it: which was ſo weakned through the infirmitie of the fleſh, that it could not poſſibly deliuer man from ſinne, &amp; from death. Which defect is not by nature of the law, but tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the naturall impotency and weaknes of man, which cannot doe that in perfect meaſure, which the lawe with great exactnes requireth. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> therfore in his booke of the Spirit and letter, ſaith very well and wiſely; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De ſpiritu &amp; lit. c.</hi> 19.</note> The law is not therefore not accompliſhed, for any fault in the law, but by the fault of the wiſdome of the fleſhe: Which fault is to be ſhewed and made manifeſt by the lawe, but to be healed through grace.</p>
               <p>The holy men of God therefore, ſeeing themſelues to come ſhort of the doing of the word and lawe, in this matter and manner of doing, haue in the humilitie of their mindes, accounted themſelues as ſinners, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue confeſſed their iniquities and tranſgreſſions, their ſinnes and vnrighteouſnes before the Lord: as the Patriarches, as <hi>Job, Dauid, Daniel,</hi> the Apoſtles, and all the Saints of God, as it appeareth.</p>
               <p>Seeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that no man is able thus to do the word, there muſt ſome other kind of doing the word be by Saint <hi>Iames</hi> here required. Therefore there is a doing of the word and law vnder the Goſpell, when Chriſt, for vs and our ſaluation, fulfilleth the law in perfect meaſure, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</note> is called the fulfilling of the law, to all that beleeue: and therewith alſo geueth vnto his Saints, as members of his body, the holy Ghoſt, the ſpirite of ſanctification, that thereby they after ſome meaſure, may truely doe his will, earneſtly cleaue vnto his word, faithfully beleeue his pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſes, vnfeinedly loue him for his goodnes, and feare him with reuerence for his mighty power. And finally, loue their neighbour, though in great infirmitie, great imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, great weaknes. This our doing of the word, and fulfilling the law of God, almighty God accepteth and taketh in good part, for his ſonnes ſake, who hath in all points and parts perfectly fulfilled the lawe, for all thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:19545:84"/> that beleeue. And this our doing of Gods worde, is not thereby to attaine to righteouſnes with God, which thing before we haue receiued by faith in Chriſt only: but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to teſtifie that by Chriſt we are made righteous before God: and partly to ſhew our obedience to God therfore, whoſe workmanſhip we are, prepared vnto good workes, that we ſhould walke therein.</p>
               <p>Such then (as knowing themſelues to be iuſtified by <note place="margin">

And hereunto ſerue ſo many exhortations in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby we are ſtirred, and pricked forward to the practiſe of good workes, and ſtudie of vertue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles are full, and the whole bodie (as it were) of the holy Scripture, therewith reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
               <p>This godly endeuour (according to the meaſure we haue receiued:) this ſtudie and practiſe of good workes &amp; vertue preſcribed: this performance of obedience offered to God, muſt ſhine in the Saints, which as neceſſarie in al profeſſorus of gods word, is ioyned with the hearing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Our Sauiour Chriſt ioyning the hearing and doing of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.</note> the word together, ſaith; That he that heareth the word &amp; doeth it, is like to a wiſe man, which buildeth his houſe on a rocke. And ſhewing whom he accounteth for his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and his mother, he ſaith; That they are his brethern <note place="margin">

               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:19545:84"/>
               <p> Finally, when he had waſhed his Diſciples feet, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them to the imitation and following of his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: in concluſion of the exhortation he ſhutteth vp the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.</note> matter in this wiſe; If you know theſe things, happie are you if you doe them. To heare or know then the will of God, and not to doe his word, preuayleth nothing. This knew the holy Prophets, who therefore ioyned practiſe of the will, with the hearing of the word and lawe of God, as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. v. 1. 5. c. v. 1. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 11. 6.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Reaſons."/> Of which admonition two are the reaſons.

               <p>Men thinke themſelues highly in the fauor of God, and perſwade themſelues that they doe GOD good and ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeruice, and haue performed the dueties of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in conuenient meaſure, when they are content to hearken and liſten to the word of God, albeit they neuer endeuour thereby to leade their liues, neither to reforme their manners thereunto. But this being nothing ſo, they greatly deceiue themſelues, and procure iuſter condemnation againſt themſelues from God. For hovv much more me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knovv by hearing, ſo much more do they enhaunce their iudgements, &amp; increaſe their puniſhment, if they vvalk not according to their knovvledge.

               <p>The hearing of our time is in many marueylous, the knoledge of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people is great, &amp; hath not been the like in any former generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this our Countrie and Nation: their vnderſtanding in the Scriptures is ſuch, as that many of the Laitie and people, can talke with glorie; reaſon with feruencie; diſpute with a grace of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God: whoſe hearts notwithſtanding, are puft vp with pride, whoſe mindes are ſet on miſchiefe, whoſe feet

So our knowledge, and talking of the Scriptures, of vices to be remoued, and vertue to be embraced, is worthy praiſe: but this is greatly to be lamented, that we, talking ſo well, doe walke ſo wickedly. Herein if we runne on ſtill, and ſo continue, we enhaunce our puniſhment, encreaſe our iudgement, enlarge our condemnation: Wherefore we muſt not be hearers onely, but doers alſo, of the worde of God, as the Apoſtle here admoniſheth.</p>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19545:86"/> of our pathes, the line and leuell of our life, and the guide of our waies to godlines.

Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in righteouſnes, holy conuerſation in life, is the vſe of the law and word of God.</p>
               <p>As therefore the chiefe ende of ſciences, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine artes, is not knowledge, but action; that when a thing is learned, it may be put in vre and practiſe: And as the vſe and ende of morall philoſophie, is not to knowe only, but to practiſe alſo: whereunto they are vnfit which lacke experience to practiſe (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teacheth) ſo the <note place="margin">1. <hi>lib.

This vſe and end men then loſe, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelues with hearing onely.</p>
               <p>Which thing the Apoſtle here proueth by a fit ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, wherein he compareth the word of God to a glaſſe. As the chiefe vſe of the glaſſe is not to ſee our faces only, but to correct our faults, that there be no blemiſh or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie therein: ſo the word of God hath this vſe, not to ſhew our ſelues only, but to reforme our enormities, that there remaine no iniquitie in vs.</p>
               <p>The word of God may well be compared to a glaſſe, <note place="margin">The word like a glaſſe.</note> Three ſpeciall properties are in a glaſſe, wherby the word is reſembled vnto it.</p>
               <p n="1">1 A glaſſe ſheweth the perfecte forme of our faces, with all the deformities and blemiſhes therein, to correct them if they may be corrected: So the lawe and worde of
<pb facs="tcp:19545:87"/> God, ſheweth the perfect face and faſhion of ſinne in vs; that ſo farre forth as natural infimitie permitteth, all ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes may be amended; for which cauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that thereby we come to ſee ſinne: and by the lawe haue knowledge thereof: becauſe by the lawe is the knowledge of ſinne, that then being knowen, we might by grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme <note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2 The glaſſe ſheweth their owne faces which looke thereinto, and not the faces of others, that they might be carefull to wipe away their owne blemiſh and dyrty ſpots, and not be curious in clearing of others: So the lawe ſheweth euery one that loketh thereinto, his owne ſinnes cheifely, not the ſinnes of his brethren: ſo much that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one ſhould be carefull of his owne life, and not be too curious in the liues of others. Wherefore holy <hi>Dauid</hi> ſo often deſired to bee informed in the lawe and ſtatutes of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86 <hi>&amp;</hi>
                  </note> God, that he him ſelfe might walke therein, and be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: as in his pſalmes many waies it appeareth: and the Apoſtle exhorting all men to make triall of themſelues by the word, not only at the receauing of Sacraments, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> by the miniſterie of the word, for the proofe of their faith, woulde not haue them as buſie in the liues of others, but as carefull of their owne; to mend themſelues; Let euerie one examine him ſelfe, and ſo let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup: And againe: proue your <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> ſelues whether you are in faith, examine your ſelues: know you not that Chriſt dwelleth in you, except ye be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates? the word muſt teach vs to ſee our ſelues, and our owne infirmities, and endeuour to reforme our owne ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes of ſinne, and not to be curious in them, ſearching into the liues of others, before our owne be throughly reformed.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The glaſſe ſheweth vs our blemiſhes, which ſeene, we hate, and with miſlike, wipe them away: ſo the worde of God ſheweth vs the deformitie of ſinne: which ſinne muſt be hated of vs: thus Gods word taught <hi>Dauid</hi> to hate his owne waies: and <hi>Marie</hi> Magdalen to loth here former life. This maketh the Saints of God to hare the very gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19545:87"/> defiled with the fleſh, and conceyue miſlike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe ſinnes, wherevnto in times paſt, they were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Theſe things being ſo, the Apoſtle compareth the word of God to a glaſſe.</p>
               <p>Of which compariſon there are two partes or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. 1 They which looke into the worde of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endeuour, or yet deſire to reforme their liues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: are like ſuch as looke into a glaſſe to ſee themſelues, but not to reforme their faults, or blemiſhes of life: as ſoone as they are gone, they forget what faſhion they were of: thus their peering, pooring, and peeping into the glaſſe, profiteth nothing: as good neuer a whit, as neuer the better. The looking or hearing of hypocrites, is like the vaine looking into glaſſes of fooles. Fooles looke into glaſſes to ſee themſelues, but not to correct any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe in them: ſo hypocrites heare the worde of God, and looke into his will to ſee it, but not to correct their maners thereby. Fooles looking into glaſſes, with perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of themſelues that they are faire, when they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: come therehence as wiſe as they went: and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites thinking themſelues righteous, when they are wicked, come as wiſe from a Sermon, as they went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As fooles looking into glaſſes, ſee not that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that which is indeede the right ſide, is the left, and the left the right: and ſo thinke all is well: So hypocrites, ſeeing not by the worde their diſordered liues, that all things are topſie turuie in them: perſwade themſelues all is well inough, and ſo are not profited. As fooles looking into glaſſes, thinke they ſee a face in deede, when they ſee but the reflexe or turning backe of a face: therefore they coll, they kiſſe, they fall in loue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes with the face ſeene in the glaſſe, as <hi>Nareiſſus</hi> did with his owne face, when he behelde himſelfe in the water: ſo hypocrites thinke their counterfeite ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to bee true holineſſe: wherefore they embrace it, they brooke it, they delight therein: they loue it, as if it were ſincere and perfect integritie. And thus they may bee compared vnto fooles looking into glaſſes,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:88"/> who heare the worde, awd looke into the law, being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to obey it.</p>
               <p>The other part of this ſimilitude is: who ſo loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth into the perfect law of libertie, hee not being a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull hearer, but a doer of the worde, ſhall be bleſſed in his deede.</p>
               <p>In which member we ſee the lawe is called perfect, and a perfect law of libertie,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Perfect, which addition <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo giueth vnto the law: The law of the Lord is perfect, conuerting the ſoule: <note place="margin">

S, <hi>John</hi> entreating of the perfection of the newe lawe which is the Goſpell, confeſſeth that therein all things which <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.</note> our Sauiour did, were not written: yet ſufficient things to be written, which men beleeuing, might thereby liue: wherefore he ſaith, Many other ſignes and tokens did Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in the preſence of his Diſciples, which are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this booke: but theſe things are written, that yee might beleeue that Ieſus is Chriſt, the ſonne of God: and that in beleeuing, ye might haue life through his name. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writeth that he kept not backe any thing from the Church of Epheſus, but hath ſhewed them all the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 20.</note> counſels of God. <hi>Tertulian</hi> crieth out, that that Church is happie, to which the Apoſtles haue powred out all the <note place="margin">Tertulian.</note> doctrine of God, euen with their owne bloud. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour promiſeth the Church a Comforter, which ſhould <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.</note> bring them into all truth. What truth is it, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt did not teach the Church?

<pb facs="tcp:19545:92"/> our own hearts, and therefore we ought to refraine our tongues.</p>
               <p>Finally, we thinke our tongues to be geuen vs to prattle at our owne pleaſures, but they are geuen as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to ſet foorth the mightie and manifolde power of God, his miracles and wonderous works which he doth towards the children of men: abuſing then our toungs at our own pleaſure, we deceue our own harts. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by not moderating our tongues, we thus deceiue our ſelues, and our owne hearts: we ought with all carefulnes to bridle &amp; moderate our tongues by the word of trueth.</p>
               <p>As not moderating our tongues, we deceiue our own hearts, ſo we deſcrie our hypoctiſie, we corrupt and defile our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and make it vaine before God: therfore ought we to moderate, and refraine our tongues: whoſe ſpeach is not good, their religion cannot be acceptable. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnleſſe we refraine our tongues, our religion is fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and in vaine.</p>
               <p>Now the euils and faults of our tongues, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they not refrained, deceiue our heartes, and make our religion vaine, are ſundrie.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Vaine talke, idle, friuolous, ſeruing to no profit, to no purpoſe, prating and pratling where there is no neede: <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.</note> for euery vaine and idle word proceeding from vs. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth the Saints to put from them all vaine and fooliſh talke, as a thing not becomming them. From this euill if we refrain not our tongues, our religion is in vain. For if any man among you ſeem religious, and refraineth not from this: this mans religion is in vaine.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Another euil to be reſtrained in men, is, when we talk of god, of his word, of his law &amp; religion: not deſirous to reforme our liues according vnto his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements. This is a great euil, and point of halting hypocrifie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our religion is fruſtrate and in vaine. For to talke of Gods word, and not to walke in his will, profiteth or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayleth nothing to religion: therefore almighty GOD
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19545:92"/> ſhewing their religion to be but in vaine, which talked of him in their mouthes, but folowed him not in their harts, crieth out; This people draweth neare vnto me with their lips, but their hearts are farre from me, worſhipping me in vaine, teaching doctrines, precepts of men,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> in Gods perſon, telling the hypocrites that their talking of his couenants was in vaine, in as much as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.</note> they would not be reformed in their conuerſations, ſaith; What haſt thou to doe to declare my ordinances, and to take my couenants in thy mouth: ſeeing thou hateſt to be reformed, and caſteſt my words behind thee.

               <p>Finally, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> accounting their religion as <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tit.</hi>
                  </note> vaine, which talke of God in their mouthes, but obey him not in their deedes, condemneth them as hypocrites, who ſay they know God in word, but deny him in deedes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abhominable, diſobedient, and to euery good worke reprobate. From this vanitie and fooliſh prating if wee refraine not our tongues, though we ſeeme neuer ſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, yet deceaue wee our ſelues, and our religion is in vaine. And yet this is our religion in theſe daies, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in lip-labour, and talking of God and his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: but not liuing according as in his lawes he char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geth vs: and therefore are we not better then very hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. For if any man among vs ſeem religious, &amp; refrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not his tongue from this vanity alſo, ſurely this mans religion is in vaine.</p>
               <p n="3">3 As from theſe euils our tongues muſt be refray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: ſo from raſh iudgement of our brethren, when vpon ſurmiſed ſuſpitions we condemne them: for this alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <note place="margin">

               <p>In which kinde they ſinne, which by euentes iudge and condemne their brethren: accounting them for moſt wicked, vppon whom the hand of the Lords chaſtiſement lighteth. The wicked iudged Chriſt condemned of God, <note place="margin">

Such as familiarly apply the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to men, they iudge as flatterers: whom they ſee graue, they conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne for Stoicall: thoſe that bear iniuries, they hold as malicious diſse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blers: they which in caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,

This euill of tongue muſt be reſtrained, otherwiſe, wee iudging after outward appearance, which Chriſt forbiddeth, chalenge that to our ſelues, which is <note place="margin">

               <p n="4">4 Another euill is flatterie, a ſpeach and report of falſe and vaine praiſe geuen to a man: when we ſpeake things that are falſe, to pleaſe men, &amp; feed their humors: when we ſay what they ſay, &amp; deny what they deny: when to ſooth men vp, we call day, night; light, darkenes: ſweet, ſower: good, euill: And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, I ſay whether in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or in doctrine: this is an euill of the to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which who ſo refraineth not, his religion is vaine. Such are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſites and flatterers, whoſe mouthes are inſtruments of falſe praiſe. Such are falſe Prophets, falſe teachers, falſe paſtors, which for feare of men, or for their fauour, either ſuppreſſe the trueth, and ſpeake it not: or els conceiue lies, and vtter them. This is pernitious in the Church, and in the Commonweale: in ſocieties and in priuate families: in all ſtates and degrees of men: into whoſe handes it is more dangerous to fall, then into the handes of Rauens, as <hi>Diogenes</hi> affirmeth. For Rauens eate mens bodies dead, but flatterers deuoure them, and feede on them liuing. Wherefore, as of wilde beaſtes tyrantes are worſt: ſo of tame beaſtes, flatterers. Which thing is ſo odious vnto God, who is the God of trueth, as that they which flatter in their lippes, make their religion vaine before him. Wherefore if any man among you ſeem religious, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraineth
<pb facs="tcp:19545:94"/> not his tongue from flattering alſo, this mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is in vaine.</p>

Vaine therefore was the religion of the Iſraelites, who promiſed their <note place="margin">

               <p n="6">6 The ſixt euill from which we muſt refraine, is ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng: which is a falſe ſignification of ſpeach or voice, with intention to deceiue. This God to abandon from his peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, willed them they ſhoulde not lie one to another. Which the Prophet expounding, exhorteth the people <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 25 <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.</note> to ſpeake the trueth one vnto another, and not to lie. The Apoſtle remouing all the workes of the old man, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with deceaueable luſtes of the fleſhe, from the true profeſſors of religion, and ſuch as were regenerate by the goſpell, whoſe religion it marreth, exhorteth in this wife: Wherefore put away all lying from you, and ſpeake the trueth one to another, for you are members one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>This euil reigneth in the tongues of many, euen profeſſing religion, and the Goſpell: whoſe houſes are vpholden, whoſe riches are increaſed, whoſe families are mainteyned, whoſe children are aduaunced, whoſe ſonnes are made Gentlemen by the lies their fathers and their ſeruants, in their ſhoppes, in their warehouſes, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19545:94"/> in other places haue made for aduauntage. But haue we thus learned Chriſt? Is not all our profeſſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in vaine, by the falſhood of our tongues? that wee may alſo with the Apoſtle conclude, that if any man or woman among vs ſeeme religious, deuout and holy, yet refraineth not his tongue from lies, but vſeth deceit in his lips, euen this mans religion is in vaine, as the Apoſtle auoucheth.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The next euill which corrupteth our religion, and maketh it vaine before God, is filthie ſpeach, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not onely our liues are deſcried to be euill: but our hearts to be wicked, and our religion counterfette. This I would men profeſſing godlines, would remember, whoſe mouthes are open oftentimes to great filthineſſe, as if thereby their religion were not defiled.</p>

And this is the ſumme of this exhortation.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt admonition, is touching the true ſeruice of God, and pure religion: Wherein he deſcribeth <note place="margin">4. <hi>Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</hi>
                  </note> certaine effects or properties of that part of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which moſt condemneth hypocrites. For many bearing a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of religion: yet neither ſhewe foorth the fruites of loue vnto others, neither are they pure and holy in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, wherefore worthely to be condemned as hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crits.</p>
               <p>Which thing the Apoſtle here concludeth: Pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and vndefiled before God the Father, is this: To viſite the fatherleſſe and widowes in their aduerſitie, and to keepe our ſelues vnſpotted of the world: as if he would ſay; Many make fare as they were religious: many ſette a face on it as if they were deuout: many prerend that they performe ſeruice vnto God, yet doe they neither walke in charitie to the poor-ward, neither in innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy towards themſelues, therfore they are but halting hypocrites, and counterfette Chriſtians: for this is onely true religion
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19545:95"/> before God, to viſite the fatherles, and widowes, in their aduerſitie, and to keepe a mans ſelfe vnſpotted of the world.</p>
               <p>If wee will deſcribe religion by her properties and effects, howe it is iudged of men, it conſiſteth in two things. 1 Charitie to the poore, 2 Innocencie and puritie of our owne liues: ſo that all that, is but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and diſſimulation, hypocriſie: which is not te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by theſe two.

               <p>Now that the Apoſtle ſayeth pure Religion, and vndefiled before God the Father, is this: it plainely argueth that there is a Religion of hypocrites allowed and approoued with themſelues, and with others in the worlde, but not with GOD: and a Religion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and appooued with GOD, though not with the worlde: and this Religion is the Religion which the Saints muſt profeſſe: and the true Religion of God: <note place="margin">1. <hi>Voca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hypocrites pleaſe themſelues as much as they will: yet is not their Religion the true Religion of God: Wherefore to put a difference betwixt Gods true Religion, and the Religion which pleaſeth our ſelues, and others, the Apoſtle ſayeth: Pure Religion and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled

               <p>Charitie is ſo neceſſarie a propertie in religion, as
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19545:96"/> that where it is wanting, there is not onely no true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, but neither any loue of God at all abiding: For the Apoſtle ſayeth, that who ſo hath this worldly goodes, and ſeeth his brother haue neede, and ſhutteth <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.</note> vp the bowels of compaſſion againſt him, the loue of God abydeth not in him.</p>

For ſuch as are riche to day, may be poore to morrowe: our riches are vncertaine, our ſtate miſerable, our condition variable: our ſelues may neede to morrowe, who to day wallow in all wealth: we may come to pouertie, which now abound in plentie: wee may bee pinched with penurie, which nowe enioy proſperitie. To the ende therefore, that we may finde mercie in miſerie, let vs ſhewe pitie in our proſperitie: knowing this, that who ſo ſhutteth his eares to the crie of the poore, ſhall crie himſelfe and not bee heard.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore wee come to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſcourſe of theſe words, it may ſeeme conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient that wee both rippe vp the whole Chapter, and alſo ſee the cohere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thereof, with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. This Chapter, as in the table appeareth, may be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two places. The firſt is againſt reſpect of perſons, when the poore, being honeſt and godly, are neglected, contemned and diſdained, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the rich and wealthie of the worlde: which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt charitie, proceeding from a true faith, which admit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth no ſuch reſpect of perſons in the faith and religion of Chriſt. The ſecond is concerning good works, which in the ſaints of god, are ioyned with faith in Ieſus Chriſt: Whereof faith voide altogether, is vaine, dead, and fruitleſſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt place is from the firſt verſe to the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth: and conſiſteth of two particular and ſpecial bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The firſt is the propoſition, conteyned in the firſt verſe. The ſeconde, the proofe and confirmation of the
<pb facs="tcp:19545:101"/> propoſition. This proofe conteyneth two reaſons: the firſt from the example of ſuch as doe thus reſpect mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: wherein three things are noted. 1 The example it ſelfe, 2. 3. 4. verſes. 2 Is the noting of the euils which are condemned in thoſe which thus haue the faith of Chriſt in reſpect of perſons, 5. 6. 7. verſes. 3 The concluſion, 8. 9. verſes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon and argument of proofe, is from the nature of the law: which law they tranſgreſſe, which haue the faith of Ieſus Chriſt in reſpect of perſons. And in this ſecond reaſon there are alſo three things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. 1 The propoſition, verſe 10. 2 The confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, verſe 11. 3 The concluſion, verſes 12. 13. And this is the ſumme of the firſt part of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the Chapter is touching good works, which as ſignes, teſtimonies, fruits &amp; effects of our faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are therunto to bee ioyned in the Saints of God. In which part there are three things ſet downe. 1 The propoſition, and ſtate of the treatiſe, verſe 14. 2 The proofe, conteining foure reaſons &amp; arguments. The one from a ſimilitude, 15. 16. 17. 18. Another from an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie which might grow, verſe 19. 3. From <hi>Abrahams</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, 20. 21. 22. 23. 4. From <hi>Rahabs</hi> example, verſe 25. 3 The concluſion: which is firſt made, verſe 24. the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe repeated, verſe 26. And this is the ſumme of this ſecond part: And in theſe two the whole Chapter is conſumed and ſpent.</p>
               <p>This being the reſolution of the Chapter, wee muſt alſo ſee how it hangeth with the former. The dependence and coherence with the former chapter then is this. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> in the firſt Chapter, from the 21. verſe to the ende, gaue out certaine admonitions, and (as it were) exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: which (as fruites or effects) flowed and roſe out of the word of God, whereby we are regenerate: as, that we ought to receiue the word with meeknes: that we muſt be doers of the worde, not hearers onely: that the worde of God reformeth and brideleth our tongues and ſpeach: that true religion, and pure ſeruing of God, conſiſteth in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19545:101"/> charitie and innocencie of life: Theſe foure propoſed in the firſt Chapter, in this place the Apoſtle addeth the fifth, which is concerning reſpect of perſons, which muſt not be in the religion and profeſſion of the faith of Chriſt: Which is from the firſt, to the fourteenth verſe. And 6. admonition, which is touching good works to be ioyned with faith: from 14. to the end. And theſe hang very well with the former treatiſe: For if true religion, and vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before God, conſiſt of two things, as in ver. 27. of the former Chapter appeareth, in charitie and innocencie: and reſpect of perſons, being againſt charitie: and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſnes of doing well againſt innocencie: the Apoſtle ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conueniently falleth into the diſcourſe of theſe things. And thus this Chapter hangeth very well together with the other, and hath a neceſſarie dependence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
               <p>And as religion conſiſteth in charitie firſt, then in innocencie of life: ſo the apoſtle firſt forewarneth of that which is contrarie to charitie and loue; namely, reſpect of perſons. Secondly, of that which is contrary vnto inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie: careleſnes of good workes, and vertue, the fruites of faith and religion.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus premiſed, the firſt place or part of this Chapter, is concerning reſpecte of perſons, which cannot ſtand with Chriſtian religion, nor charitie: <note place="margin">5. <hi>Admonition,</hi>

                  </note> which I haue noted two things. 1 The propoſition. 2 The confirmation. The former of theſe two; that is, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, is conteined in the firſt verſe, ſet down vnto you: Wherein I obſerue</p>

               <p> 1 The perſons whom Saint <hi>Iames</hi> admoniſheth here, are the brethren, to whom he geueth this attribute, and calleth them by the name of brethren: which thing hee doeth very conuemently, in as much as in the diſcourſe he is to admoniſh them of a duetie of loue: whereunto they ought to be the more prompt, in that they are bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: therefore ſaith he; My brethren.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Brethren in holy Scriptures are ſundry waies ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. 1 They are tearmed brethren which are of the ſtock of <hi>Adam:</hi> of whom, as of one ſtock and bloud, the whole world, and all mankind was made: therefore in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall acception and taking of brethren, all men in the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 17.</note> whole world are brethren. Thus the poore and the riche, the noble and the baſe botne, the wiſe and the fooliſh, the learned and the ignorant, the maſter and his ſeruant, the Soueraigne and the Subiect, the teacher and the ſcholer, the Prince and the people, are brethren.</p>
               <p n="2">2 More narrowly and properly they are called bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who come of the ſame patents, who haue the ſame father and mother, or at the leaſt one of them; as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abell</hi> were brethren, properly and fully: to whome <hi>Seth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.</note> after the death of <hi>Abell,</hi> was alſo brother: for they were the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Euah,</hi> the ſame parents. <hi>Iſmael</hi> &amp; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 35.</note> 
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> hauing <hi>Abraham</hi> for their father, were brethren, though the children of diuers mothers. <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> being the ſonnes of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca,</hi> were brethren. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> and <hi>Beniamin,</hi> the two ſonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> by <hi>Rachel,</hi> were properly brethren, in as much as they had both the ſame father, and ſame mother alſo. And they which haue the ſame parents, either both, or one at the leaſt, are called <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.</note> naturall brethren, becauſe they drawe their beginning, and naturall birth from one fountain, and from the ſame parents.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Beſides theſe, after the manner of the Hebrewes, they are called brethren who come of one line and race, albeit in diuers degrees: So the Hebrewes called their couſins and kinſmen, brethren: as <hi>Abraham,</hi> to appeaſe &amp; ſtay the debate and ſtrife betwixt his heardmen and <hi>Lots,</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:19545:102"/> his nephew, calleth <hi>Lot</hi> (his brothers ſonne) brother: Let there be no ſtrife betweene vs and our heardmen, for we are brethren.</p>
               <p>Thus the couſins of Chriſt, after this phraſe of the Hebrewes, are called his brethren. When our Sauiour <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.</note> Chriſt was preaching within the houſe to the people, there came newes to him, that his mother and brethren ſtoode without, deſirous to ſpeake with him: &amp; they which were there called his brethren, were <hi>Iames, Ioſes, Simon,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> the couſins of Chriſt, and the ſonnes of <hi>Marie Cleopha,</hi> ſiſter to the bleſſed virgin: as in the next place &amp; Chapter of the Euangeliſt is recorded, who reporteth, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.</note> that the Iewes ſeeing the wonderfull workes and myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which he did, in murmuring and diſdainfull manner ſpake of him and his kinred, and ſaid; Is not this the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters ſonne? is not his mother, Mary? are not his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Ioſes, Simon</hi> and <hi>Judas?</hi> Theſe were not his naturall brethren, neither the ſonnes of <hi>Mary</hi> the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, but his couſins germane, and the ſonnes of <hi>Alpheus,</hi> the husbande of <hi>Mary Cleopha,</hi> the ſiſter of the bleſſed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. S. <hi>John</hi> calleth Chriſtes kinſmen, who in reproachfull <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 7</note> manner willed him to depart from them, and to goe into Iudea, to ſhewe himſelfe vnto his Diſciples, by the name of brethren: wherefore he ſaid; that in the feaſt of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles his brethren ſaid vnto him; Depart hence, and goe into Iudea, that thy Diſciples may ſee the workes thou doeſt: calling his kinsfolke by the name of brethren, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſpeech of the Hebrewes. <hi>Iacob</hi> comming <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.</note> to <hi>Rachell</hi> the daughter of <hi>Laban,</hi> telleth her that he was her fathers brother, and the ſonne of <hi>Rebecca. Rebecca</hi> was ſiſter to <hi>Laban,</hi> and <hi>Laban</hi> vncle to <hi>Iacob,</hi> yet when he properly ſpeaking, ſhould haue ſaid; I am thy fathers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewe, he ſaith; I am his brother: which was common to the Hebrewes. And <hi>Laban</hi> himſelfe, beating a price with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>verſe</hi> 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Iacob</hi> what he would take to ſerue him, calleth <hi>Iacob</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after the ſame manner; though thou be my brother, yer ſhalt thou not ſerue me for nought.</p>
               <p>Thus both in the old, and alſo in the new teſtament,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:103"/> the holy Ghoſt vſing the phraſe of the Hebrewes, calleth ſuch as are but kinsfolke, and of kinde, as couſins, by the name of brethren, vſing the word Brother, much more largely.</p>
               <p n="4">4 To come nearer vnto the Apoſtle, in the whole booke of God, both the olde, and alſo the new teſtament, they are often called brethren, which were of the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; which ſerued the ſame true and liuing God; which were of the ſame profeſſion. After which acception of brethren, the Hebrewes in the olde lawe, and the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans vnder the Goſpell, are brethren. <hi>Moſes</hi> therefore, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.</note> two Hebrewes contend and ſtriue together, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them, and to ſtay the contention, asketh them why they ſtroue together ſeeing they were brethren: yet bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren onely in reſpect of their religion, wherein they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing, were called brethren. Which is alſo the meaning of the lawe, which willed the Iſraelites, when they came <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.</note> into the land of Canaan, if therin any of their brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fel into pouertie and decay, they ſhoulde helpe him, releeue him, ſuccour him: whereunto almighty God reſpected, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.</note> when for a time, for the hardnes of their harts, he forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the people to take of their brethren: ſuffered them to take vpon vſurie of ſtrangers: accounting all the Iewes as brethren, becauſe they ſerued the true and liuing god; but the Nations and people of other Countries, as ſtrangers: becauſe they agreed not with them in their religion. In which ſence the lawe ſpeaketh, when it either forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, or permitteth this or that to bee done vnto the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>The newe teſtament following the old herein, and the Apoſtles &amp; holy men of God in the primitiue church, imitating the examples of the Saintes in the time of the law and Prophetes, call in like manner thoſe brethren, which are of the ſame religion and profeſſion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Wherefore Saint <hi>Peter</hi> (immediately after Chriſtes aſcenſion) ſpeaking to the Diſciples and profeſſors of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 1.</note> Goſpell, made this oration vnto them; Men and brethren, this Scripture muſt needes haue beene fulfilled, which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19545:103"/> the holie Ghoſt by the mouth of <hi>Dauid,</hi> had ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>Judas,</hi> which was guide to thoſe which tooke Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. <note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> Men and brethren. Not long after ſpeaking vnto the people, after the diſcenſion of the holy Ghoſt, wherewith they being repleniſhed, were thought to haue bene drunk with new wine: in his ſermon then made, he crieth out: Men and brethren. I may boldly ſpeake vnto you of the Patriarke <hi>Dauid,</hi> &amp;c. The twelue Apoſtles ordayning <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 6.</note> Deacons in the Church, ſpeaking to thoſe which profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Goſpel, ſay in this maner: wherefore brethren, looke you out among you, ſeuen men of honeſt report, and full of the holy Ghoſt, and of wiſedome, whome we may appoint to this buſineſſe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his Sermon <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 13.</note> at Antiochia in Piſidia, giueth this appellation to the profeſſours: Men and brethren, children of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and whoſoeuer among you feareth God: to you is the word of this ſaluation ſent: and a litle after: Be it knowne vnto you therfore, men and brethren, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 38.</note> that through this man is preached vnto you the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes. Thus muſt we take brethren, when in their Epiſtles the Apoſtles call the Saints brethren: as <hi>Paul</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in euery Epiſtle: S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> happily, not rarely, vſe it: reputing them for brethren, who profeſſe the ſame faith and religion of Chriſt. In which ſenſe our Apoſtle is to bee taken alſo, who in this propoſition no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the perſons whom he admoniſheth, calleth them his brethren: My brethren.</p>
               <p>And this is the holy and ſpirituall brotherhoode, whereinto we are knit in Chriſt, in whom, and by whom, we are the ſonnes of God, and an heauenly and holy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood among our ſelues.</p>
               <p>The Saints of God may well here be called brethren: 1 Becauſe they haue one ſpirituall, ghoſtly, and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father, which is God: who is father of vs all: of whom <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.</note> are all things, and we in him. Which <hi>Paul</hi> vſeth as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to pricke and prouoke vs vnto loue: there is one <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.</note> God and father of all, which is aboue all, and through you all, and in you all: therefore our Sauiour maketh God his
<pb facs="tcp:19545:104"/> father, and the father of all the Saints: I aſcend to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.</note> and your father: my God, and your God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As becauſe we haue one ſpirituall father, we are brethren: ſo becauſe we haue one ſpirituall mother, we are brethren: nowe as God is our ghoſtly Father: ſo is the Church our myſticall mother: that moſt chaſte ſpouſe of Chriſt, which hath brought vs forth by a newe birth: in whoſe ſweete boſome we are nourſed: into whoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie lappe we are gathered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with whoſe fruitfull breaſts we are fed: who dayly cheriſheth vs for hir owne, with the ſincere milke of the worde: with the exceeding comfort of the Sacraments: and bringeth vs vp vnder the moſt wholſome diſcipline of Ieſus Chriſt: that we might be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; blameles before him through loue. Who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if we agnize not, and recount as our mother, neither may we preſume <note place="margin">

Chriſtians therefore, <note place="margin">De ſimpli praelato.</note> and the vnfeined profeſſours of true religion, hauing the Church for their common &amp; miſticall mother, are a miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and ſpirituall brotherhood among themſelues.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Neither that onely, but they are alſo begotten with one ſeede of their new birth and regeneration: which is <note place="margin">

This the Apoſtle Saint <hi>James</hi> hath foretolde, and foretaught vs: when diſputing of the cauſes of our new birth, he ſayeth: of his owne will begate he vs, with the worde of truth, that we ſhould bee the firſt fruits of his creatures.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19545:104"/> becauſe they are all begotten with the immortall ſeed of the word of God, the inſtrument of their regeneration.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If Chriſt vouchſafe vs the name of brethren, and ſo we haue him as a common brother: then are we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo brethren by right among our ſelues. For as thoſe men, which haue one third for their brother, are brethren among themſelues in nature: as <hi>Iames</hi> &amp; <hi>Ioſes</hi> hauing <hi>Iude</hi>

                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.</note> therof aſſuring vs, he telleth <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſhe muſt go to his brethren, the apoſtles: &amp; tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he was aſcended to his father, and their father: to his God, &amp; their God. Now <note place="margin">

And a little after, inferring this as graunted, he ſayeth: It became him in all things to bee like his brethren, that hee might bee mercifull, and a faithfull high Prieſt in things appertayning to God. Finally, Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> thoſe whome hee knewe before, hath hee alſo predeſtinate, to bee like the image of his ſonne, <note place="margin">

               <p n="5">5 Finally, inaſmuch as the Saints diuide the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among them, therfore are they called brethren. For brethren they are, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> writeth, among who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <note place="margin">

Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſheweth in like manner, that there is one inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, one common kingdome, the ſame promiſes of life <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.</note> to all the Saints of God: wherefore he ſaith, that they all are by the ſame promiſes made partakers of the ſame hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly nature. In regard therefore of their inheritance, which is one to all the Saints, they are alſo brethren.</p>
               <p>And this diuine and heauenly brotherhoode is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and broken, when either by erronious doctrine, or corruption in religion, or diſſention in opinion, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull contempt, the poore and true Saints, are diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and troubled. <note place="margin">Frater fere alter: almost another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, of like condition.</note>

               <p n="1">1 What is here ment by faith? Chriſtian religion, the true ſeruice of Chriſt: the profeſſion of the Goſpel: whereunto reſpect of perſons is contrarie.

This glorie of Chriſt, yea this glory of his poore ſaints, if we would eſteem as we ought: there would not be ſuch reſpect of perſons as there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men: to eſteeme of the riche and wealthie, though prophane and wicked: and to contemne and diſdainfully account of the poore, albeit vertuous and godly.</p>
               <p n="3">3 To haue this faith of Chriſt our glorious Lord in reſpect of perſons, is to eſteeme the faith, religion, and profeſſion of Chriſt, by the outward appearance of men. VVhich this Apoſtle here condemning, ſaieth: My bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, haue not the faith of our glorious Lord Ieſus Chriſt in reſpect of perſons. VVhich place giueth vs occaſion to conſider theſe foure things. 1 VVhat reſpect of perſons is. 2 That reſpect of perſons in all things, and all men, by the ſcriptures of God is coudemned. 3 How many waies reſpect of perſons is had, and offence therby committed. 4 That reſpect of perſons cannot ſtand with the faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and profeſſion of the goſpel, neither with chriſtian charitie, &amp; loue: of all thoſe which call vpon Ieſus Chriſt, eſpecially to be nouriſhed and cheriſhed.</p>
               <p n="1">1 What is reſpect of perſons? it is to reſpect anie thing, beſides the cauſe and matter it ſelfe, which onely ought of vs to be conſidered: whereby we decline from the matter, to the man: from the thing, to the perſon: and ſwarue from equitie, righteous iudgement, and true eſtimation of things. VVhich thing may appeare more euident, by examples one or two ſet downe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. If then for example ſake, two men laboure in the Church or common wealth, for one and the ſame office, vpon a worthie man onely to be conferred: the one
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19545:107"/> very worthie, and fitte for the place, but neither kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, friend, familiar, nor of acquaintance: the other, not worthy, yet near vnto vs by birth, linked with vs in league of loue, of our familiar and beſt acquaintance: to look vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to kinred, familiaritie, and acquaintance: and not to the worthines of the man, and neceſſitie of the place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we ought to haue regard: this is reſpect of perſons: for we regard not ſo much the worthines which ought to be in him, whom we ſhould thereunto promote, as we doe to his perſon whom we haue promoted. In like manner, if two men haue committed like treſpaſſe, thereby deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing either Bridewell, Newgate, or Tiburne, or any ſuch like puniſhment: yet the one our frend, rich, honorable: the other a ſtranger, poore, miſerable: to ſpare the one for his riches, honor, friendſhippe: and to puniſh the other, is reſpect of perſons, and falling from iuſtice. If two ſtand in need of our helpe, the one lewde, yet neare vnto vs: the other honeſt, yet further of: to haue regard to kinred, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie or any ſuch reſpect, and not to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſt, Geue to euery one that asketh, &amp; to him <note place="margin">

               <p>Thus then to looke vnto, or reſpect any thing, beſide the matter and cauſe it ſelfe onely to be regarded: is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons. To which euill it apperteineth to haue conſideration of kith or kinne; of ſexe or kinde; affinitie or conſanguinite; nobilitie or auncientrie; friendſhippe or familiaritie; condition or countrie; birth or parentage; pompe or riches; power or might, or ſuch like: To fixe our affections vpon externall things; to eſteeme according to the outward appearance of men; and in regarde thereof,

                     <hi>John</hi> 7.</note> iudgement and reſpect of perſons from the profeſſors of religion: willeth that men iudge not according to the out ward appearance, but according to righteous iudgement: geuing a moſt diuine and heauenly admonition to al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to iudge according to the trueth of things, not to regarde mens perſons, leaſt thereby they were turned away from righteouſnes in iudgement: as were the fooliſh Iewes, who <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.</note> ſeeing his baſenes, accounted him for an abiect of Galile, the ſonne of a poore Carpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter, whoſe kinred was of mean condition: and in reſpect of his perſon they condemned him, not looking to the matter and trueth which he prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched among them. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeeing this reſpect of mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and eſteeming by the outwarde appearance of men: <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.</note> wiſely and wel forewarneth his Scholer <hi>Timothie</hi> to do the duetie of a Miniſter, without preferring one to another: neither to doe any thing partially. Finally, our Apoſtle in this place agreeably to the Scriptures, admoniſheth the brethren not to haue the faith of Chriſt in reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Thus then both in the olde &amp; in the new teſtament: is this euil condemned as repugnant to iuſtice, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to charitie, diſſonant and diſagreeing to the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 This euill is diuerſly committed, both generally and particularly of men. 1. When in our meetings and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian aſſemblies, we account of men not for their vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> religion, honeſtie: but for their countenance they beare, the pompe they ſhewe, their riches wherewith they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued. This ſeemeth to haue been co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted by me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their publique meetings in S. <hi>Iames</hi> his time: wherein they mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured &amp; eſteemed Chriſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the faith of Chriſt, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iames</hi> 2.</note> according to the outward appearance of men: reputing thoſe that caried greateſt pompe and ſhew, the moſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious: By which meane the poor which were religious in deede, became vile, contemptible and diſdained. Which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil hath ouerwhelmed our church &amp; countrey: for now in theſe times, wherein Lady money &amp; Queen riches raigne ouer men, as it neuer did more in the worlde: euery man is ſo much eſteemed and regarded, how much he is worth
<pb facs="tcp:19545:109"/> and as he is great in honor, and ſo according to his riches and honor, ſo is his eſtimation: be they otherwiſe murthe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rers, extortioners, oppreſſors, caterpillers, vſurers, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, adulterers, epicures, blaſphemers, dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kerds, or what ſoeuer. Thus the wicked for riches and worldly pompe are regarded: the poore for their baſenes are contemned, thruſt to wall, ouerruled, be they neuer ſo honeſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it commeth to paſſe, that ſeeing all thinges now are meaſured and eſteemed by riches, glorie and worldlie pompe: and no regard of honeſtie, no rewarde for vertue, no place for religion: therefore all men geue themſelues to heaping and hoording vp of riches, to brauerie of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, to hunting after honor and worldly preferment: that for the one, or the other, they may be eſteemed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men. Thus couetouſnes, pride, ambition, and vainglorie is foſtered, nouriſhed, and cheariſhed greatly: vertue, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, true honeſtie, is depreſſed and caſt downe. Thus to meaſure &amp; eſteem the religion and faith of Chriſt, by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, and in Chriſtian aſſemblies and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke meetings, to preferre the rich, wealthie, honourable, and pompous perſons, with the contempt and diſdaine of the poore brethren, is one way wherby the faith of Chriſt is had in reſpect of perſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Moreouer, men haue the faith of Chriſt in reſpect perſons, when in the Sacraments of the Church we haue reſpect to mens perſons: as, by miniſtring the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts with greater reuerence and care, to the rich, then to the poore: when at the Lords table we diſdaine to ioyne the the poore and the rich together. The Sacraments equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to all: like reuerence ought to be vſed in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring them to the poore, as to the rich: the Lords table is common to all, whereat (ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſostome)</hi> the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect differeth not from the Souetaigne and Prince: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor. hom</hi> 18.</note> the Prieſt from the people. To parte them therefore in the adminiſtration of Sacraments, and to preferre the rich with the contempt of the poore, is alſo to haue the faith of Chriſt in reſpect of perſons: which is here conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Thus the rich, mightie, and honourable, who diſdain
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19545:109"/> herein their poore Chriſtian brethren, ſinne: thus ſuch miniſters, as herein pleaſe and delight the humors of the wealthie, with diſcountenancing of the godly brethren, offend alſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Profeſſors and hearers haue the faith of Chriſt in reſpect of perſons, when they heare the word of God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the mans ſake, not for the words ſake: or when they heare it of this man, and not of another, becauſe of his perſon. Wherein many greeuouſly offende in our dayes. Such as wil heare none but thoſe that haue taken degrees of ſchoole. Which thing though it be worthely accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of among all wiſe men, yet therefore contemning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which haue not like degrees, yet happely equall ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents: is reſpect of perſons. Such as will heare this man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is formall, and not another becauſe hee refuſeth ſome ceremonies in the Church: or this man, becauſe he refuſeth, and not another becauſe hee admitteth theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things: they alſo haue the faith of Ieſus Chriſt in reſpect of perſons. Such as heare this man becauſe hee is euer inueying againſt Biſhops, pluralities: two liuinges, <note place="margin">Albeit they ſcarce make one.</note> and contemne ſuch as haue the liuinges, and therein la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as learnedly, as painfully, as fruitfully, as others: they in like manner haue the faith of Chriſt in reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Thus they heare the word nowe, not for the wordes ſake, but for the mans ſake: thus they decline from the thing to the perſon, and ſo are partiall in their hearing. For the word is the word, whether a Doctot of diuinitie preach it, or a man learned, yet not graduat: whether one ſubſcribing to ceremonies, or not ſubſcribing, whether one with one liuing or with two liuings, whether this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <note place="margin">As they term ſmall charges or benefices.</note> or that man preach it. Wherefore, not indifferently to heare it of al, but for this or that reſpect to heare it of one not of another: is to haue the faith of Chriſt in reſpect of perſons, and a ſinne worthely condemned, euen in them, which in outward ſhew pretend greateſt holines, perfiteſt religion, moſt feruent zeale to the word: which vnleſſe they leaue, &amp; therof vnfeynedly repent, I proteſt vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:110"/> in the feare of God, that they doe againſt duetie, that they flatter themſelues in their owne follie: that their religion is not pure and vndefiled before God: that they haue the faith of Ieſus Chriſt in reſpect of perſons, and therfore are guilty of great iniquitie and vngodlines, beefore the Lord: euen of peeuiſh curioſitie. The Paſchall Lamb was commanded to be eaten, the quarters, the head, the feete, the purtenance: it had been great peeuiſhnes, and vaine <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.</note> curioſitie for the people to haue ſaid; Wee will chuſe this peece, and we that: we the quarters, and we the head: wee the feete, and ſo euery one what him luſted: where all were commaunded to eate all: Euen ſo is it peeuiſhneſſe for vs to chuſe what wee will heare, or of whom: when we muſt heare al the will of God, and that of all Preachers.</p>
               <p>Finally, in this kinde they ſinne before God moſt horribly, who therefore will not heare their owne, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prechers, becauſe they inueigh ſharply againſt their pride, their brauerie, their flaunting ruffes, their coloured haire, their diuerſitie of ſtarches, their borowed frilles, &amp; ſuch like vanities: againſt their vſuries, extortions, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes, blaſphemies, and all manner iniquitie. This is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a great point of vngodlines, a manifeſt token of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet religion, a plaine argument of halting hypocriſie, and the hauing of the faith of Chriſt in reſpect of perſons by the Apoſtle no doubt, as other kindes, condemned. To <note place="margin">

Wherein the rule of equitie is broken, the law of iuſtice is violate, which requireth that that be giuen to euerie one, which appertayneth to euery one.

               <p>This place taketh not away degrees of honour from men: neither denieth it honour or worſhip to be giuen to men of honour or worſhippe, albeit wicked and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie: neither preacheth the apoſtle diſordered confuſion, as the Libertines and Anabaptiſts in former times haue,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:113"/> and now phantaſtica land vnbrideled ſpirites doe: who would remoue degreles of honour and calling, not onely out of the Church, but I feare out of the common wealth alſo. For the Scriptures haue taught vs: the Prophets haue confirmed by examples: our Sauiour Chriſt hath willed: and the Apoſtles haue inioyned honour to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, euen to the idolatrous, vnworthie &amp; wicked perſons. S. <hi>Iamet</hi> here onely teacheth, not to eſteeme or iudge of the faith and religion of Chriſt in men, by their outward appearance: neither in the publike meetings of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to reuerence, honour, preferre the wealthy and rich men of the world, being prophane &amp; wicked, with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing, diſcountenancing, and diſdaining of the poore which are religious, as the words themſelues import: when to the rich, men ſay, ſit here in a good and worſhipfull place: and to the poore, ſit there: or ſit vnder my foote-ſtoole: which argueth diſdainfull contempt of the poore brethren. For if in ſpectacles, and theatrical ſights, in elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of officers, in parliaments: in aſſiſes and ſeſſions, and in al well ordered aſſemblies and meetings of men, there is difference of men, and comlineſſe of perſons obſeured: how much more in eccleſiaſticall meetings, and chriſtian conuenticles, ought there an order to be obſerued? wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the primitiue church was carefull: appointing their place for the miniſters: theirs for the laitie: theirs for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were to be catechiſed: theirs for them which were to doe penaunce, and make open acknowledgement of their offences. The ſame was ratified by counſels: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by fathers: and for the buſineſſe of the Churches, or the reprouing of mens vices, and correcting of them which fel: both <hi>Tertulian,</hi> and S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> writeth, that there <note place="margin">

So then all difference and degrees of men are not here forbidden: but in Chriſtian aſſemblies to reſpect the rich, with the contempt and diſdaine of the poore, is condemned in this example. As ſuch then as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:19545:113"/> preferre a man for his gold ring, or gay garments: but contemne the poore for his vile and miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: making outward pompe, riches &amp; glorie: when they ſhould make, ſoundneſſe of faith, the zeale of religion, the ſinceritie of the heart, and care of Gods glorie, the difference of men, therein greatly offended. So when we haue the faith of Chriſt in eſtimation for the perſons ſake: and iudge of religion, by riches, wealth, honour: we offend in like maner, in hauing the faith of Chriſt in reſpect of perſons; and by this example are here condemned.</p>
               <p>By which it commeth to paſſe, that rich men, weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie men, honourable men, oftentimes puft vp, and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with pride, that euery were they are regarded, diſdain and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne all other: thus often times vile men, vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, prophane &amp; vngodly, are exalted: and thoſe in whom vertue flouriſheth, faith ſhineth, wiſedome appeareth: are ſuppreſſed and not regarded: which is a thing intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Chriſtian profeſſion. Hereby men are partiall in themſelues, and become iudges of euill thoughts, being euill affected in ſo great a matter.</p>

But you haue deſpiſed the poore. Their iudgement is naught and peruerſe, who iudge contrarie vnto God: this men do which honour the rich which are prophane and wicked, &amp; contemne the poore which are godly. For God contemneth the proud and wicked, be they neuer ſo rich, neuer ſo wealthie, neuer ſo noble, neuer ſo honourable: &amp; <note place="margin">

               <pb facs="tcp:19545:114"/>
               <p> That God honoureth the poore, whom men contemne and deſpiſe, the Apoſtle teacheth: in that he calleth them to be rich in faith, and heires of the kingdome promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto thoſe which loue him. To contemne the poore whom God accounteth of, and to diſdaine them whome God honoureth, is great peruerſneſſe in iudgement.

               <p n="2">2 The rich oppreſſe the poore by tyrannie, when in the trades of this life they deale hardly, deceitfully, vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> forewarneth <note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.</note> of this oppreſſion; Let no man oppreſſe or defraude his brother in bargaining, for the Lord is an auenger of ſuch things. When the rich men haue gotten commodities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, and make the poore pay therefore what themſelues luſt: when they make the poore pay deere whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they might affoord it cheaper: when rich men geue mean wares to the poore for the beſt; euill for good; putrified &amp; corrupt, for ſound &amp; curra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they oppreſſe the poor by tyrannie. This oppreſſion in all times, and in al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, in all coaſtes and countreyes of the worlde, is vſed: whereby the poore (through the tyrannie of the rich) are oppreſſed. For which the rich ought to be accounted accurſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The poore are oppreſſed alſo by tyrannie of the rich and wealthie, when they wryng them by vſurie, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures, exactions, impoſitions, and vll manner extortio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As the rich oppreſſed the poore by tyrannie, in the time of the Prophet <hi>Iſai;</hi> where againſt he crieth out and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneth: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai</hi> 3.</note> What haue ye to doe, that ye beate my people to peeces, and grinde the faces of the poor, ſaith the Lord, euen the Lord of hoſtes? Almighty God in the Princely Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> crieth out againſt this tyrannous oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Doe not all workers of wickednes knowe, that they <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.</note> eate vp my people as they eate bread? Thus were the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple oppreſſed by the tyrannie of the riche, in the time of <hi>Micheas</hi> the Prophet, whereof he ſpake in this wiſe: They hate the good, and loue the euill: they pluck their skinnes from them, and the fleſh from their bones: and they eate <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Miche.</hi> 3.</note>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:19545:116"/> vp the fleſh of my people, and flay off their skinnes from them: they breake their bones, and choppe them in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as for the potte, and as fleſh within the cauldron.</p>
               <p>Thus the Prophet condemneth their Iudges, officers, rulers, and rich men of the land, for their cruel extortio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, exactions, oppreſſions: whereby they might be very well compared to Wolues, Beares, Lions, and ſauage Beaſtes: which rent and teare the fleſh from the bones, the skinne from the backes, the partes from the body: ſo outragious is their crueltie. Theſe cruel perſons, for their tyrannous perſecution and oppreſſion, may be compared to the fiſh Sargus, which haunting the Aegyptian ſea, oppreſſeth the little fiſhes, catching al their meat and reliefe from them. They are not vnlike the fiſh Scarus, which ſome take to be the Gilthead, or Goldenie. Which fiſh chaweth cud like a beaſt, and deuoureth all the little fiſhes which meete him.</p>
               <p>Such are the rich men of this worlde againſt the poore: for like Sargus, they deuour the meat, ſuſtenance and liuing of the poore, and eate vp the laboures of their hands, and the ſweate of their browes; licking and wiping the fatte from the beard of the poore. Like Scarus, they deuour the poore of the land, and eate vp the people as it were bread. Theſe growe rich of the pouertie, waxe fatte of the need, feed ful of the emptines, cloath themſelues of the nakednes, houſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues by the vnharbouring, prank vp the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues by the penurie, make themſelues mery by the miſerie of the poore: and ſo oppreſſe them by tyrannie: for which they ſhould be held accurſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Finally, rich men oppreſſe the poore, when they weary and waſte the bodies of the poore with toileſome labour vnrewarded: as the Landlord vſeth the poore Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: the rich the poore, without hire: to whom they doe ſeruice, for whom they labour, toile and moile, for feare: afflicted and oppreſſed by their tyrannie. Here<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is it, that in ſundrie places of the land, the poore Farmer is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to carte, to carrie, to plowe, to ſowe, to fetch, to beare, to doe all manner buſines for the tyrannous oppreſſion
<pb facs="tcp:19545:117"/> of the Gentleman. Thus and by like meanes, the rich op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the poore by tyrannie, ought rather to be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted accurſed: then with the contempt and diſdaine of the poore, to be preferred. Seeing therefore the rich by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie waies afflict the poore, for the which we ſhould hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as execrable: it is a point of madnes for men through partiall reſpect had to their perſons, to honour them with contempt of the poore which are godly.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Another and ſeconde euill for which they ought to be helde accurſed, is their crueltie and vnmercifulnes. <note place="margin">Vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes.</note> For they drawe the poore before iudgement ſeates: either for their profeſſion and religion, as in the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle was vſuall. For, for the profeſſion of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the holy Apoſtles, the bleſſed Martyrs, the faithfull ſeruants of Chriſt, were drawen before ſeates of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: as in the whole booke of the Actes of the Apoſtles, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;c</hi>
                  </note> in the ſtories Eccleſiaſticall, by <hi>Euſebius, Nicephorus, Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and others written, is apparantly euident. Or els for their debts they cruelly handle them: and other for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of no great waight: or when loue woulde forgeue all, bring them before ſeates of iudgement, ſue them in the lawe: wearye them with this Court or that, and ſhewe all vnmercifulnes againſt them.</p>
               <p>Thus it is with men in our age: let a poore man owe ought to the rich, he ſhall forfette his bande, he ſhall paye for the time, he ſhalbe ſued for the debt with all vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes and crueltie: he ſhalbe forced to ſatisfie to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt farthing: which is a ſinne for which the prophane rich men are to be accounted accurſed. Or finally, when rich men pretende title to the right of the poore: and ſo wrongfully ſue him, to take from him his right, patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, purchaſe, or inheritance: partly by his owne counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, partly by his riches: calling the poor before iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for his owne.</p>
               <p>Not that it is now not lawfull for any rich man to ſue the poore for his right: or that all rich men doe bring the poore before iudgement ſeates alwaies: for as it is lawfull for the rich to get his owne in ſome reſpectes: So
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19545:117"/> neither doth euery rich man ſue euery poore man which is indangered vnto him: but becauſe the prophane, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and wicked rich men commonly ſo doe: and that then when they ſhould forgeue for Chriſtes ſake: as when the poore is vnable to pay; when he is godly, and deſirous to liue by his labour, and endeuoureth to liue out of debt and danger, and yet cannot. Now to call ſuch before iudgement ſeates: to ſue them for extremities: to ſollicite and trouble ſuch, and with crueltie to ſeeke the vttermoſt of them: is mercileſnes and crueltie, for which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane rich men are to bee accounted execrable and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed. Theſe wicked, prophane, vngodly rich men, care not for wife nor children houſhold nor familie of their poore diſtreſſed brethren: they regarde neither vertue, religion, godlines, nor honeſtie: they turne their eyes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their pouertie, vnablenes, carefull endeuour: they will be ſatisfied, they will caſt them in priſon, bring them to ſeats of iudgement, keepe them in durance: they wil make dice of their bones, but they will haue the extremitie of them: and the more godly men be, the more theſe tirannes rage againſt them: forgeuing rather great ſummes to the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous, prodigall, laſciuious, wicked, and wanton per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: then to releaſe ſmall matters to the godly. Seeing then the rich vſe ſuch vnmercifulnes towards the poore, (for which we ſhould rather account them curſed) it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth great madnes in men ſo partially to honour them, which are thus wicked.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The third ſinne and euill in the rich men of the <note place="margin">Blaſphemie.</note> world, wherefore they are to be helde accurſed: is their blaſphemie againſt the religion of Chriſt: they blaſpheme the worthie name whereby ye are named. You are named after Chriſt, Chriſtians; this worthie name is by prophane rich men blaſphemed: they blaſpheme the worthy name which is called vpon you: that is, where after you are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or named. The Apoſtle according to the phraſe of the Hebrewes ſpeaketh; As the name of the father is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon by the child, that is, the childe is named after the name of the father. Which phraſe <hi>Iacob</hi> vſed when hee

The name of the husbande is alſo called vpon by the wife: that is the wife is named after her husband, as the Prophet <hi>Iſai</hi> ſpeaketh; In that daye ſhall ſeuen women take holde of one man, and ſay; Wee will <note place="margin">

               <p>Vnder the Goſpell. Chriſtian religion and the name of Chriſt, is called vpon Chriſtians: that is, Chriſtians are named after the name of Chriſt, as here the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. The worthy name of Chriſt which was called vpon the Saints: that is, whereby the Saints were named: being Chriſtians, of Chriſt: by the wicked worldlings, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men of the earth, is blaſphemed, and euill ſpoaken
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19545:118"/> of. For rich men commonly are enemies vnto religion: and either openly they blaſpheme it, or ſecreatly ſcorne at it. So that as not many wiſe (according to the fleſhe) nor many noble, nor many mightie, are called thereunto: ſo neither many rich men, becauſe their happineſſe, truſt, and confidence, is in their wealth, which withholdeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> comming to the kingdome of GOD. For the which cauſe our Sauiour pronounceth it eaſier for a Camell to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.</note> paſſe through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of God. Seeing then theſe prophane rich men diſhonour God and his Goſpell: it were madnes for you his children to geue honour vnto them.</p>
               <p>The worthie name of Chriſt and his Goſpell, as generally of all men, ſo ſpecially of prophane rich men, may two wayes be blaſphemed, diſhonoured, and euil ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</p>
               <p n="1">1 When they deride, ieſt, ſcorne, and ſcoffe at Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion: ſpeaking maliciouſly, diſdainfully, againſt Chriſt and his profeſſion. Thus the Scribes and Phariſies, with the Iewes, blaſphemed the worthy name of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, when they called Chriſt Samaritan: when they ſaide hee caſt out deuils by the power of <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.</note> prince of the deuils: when they called and counted his doctrine, deceite, hereſie, newe and ſtrange doctrine, not to be ſuffered. Thus <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtata blaſphemed this worthie name, when in contempt he called Chriſt Galile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Carpenters ſonne, the man crucified. Thus <hi>Porphirius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note> the Philoſopher, <hi>Lucian</hi> the ſcorner, blaſphemed the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie name whereby we are called, when they reuiled, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, ſpoke euill of, and ſcorned the Goſpell. The Heathen Philoſophers, and <hi>Galen</hi> the famous Phyſicion, calling and counting it follie, blaſphemed it. All men which by vile ſpeeches, diſgrace, diſcredite, reproach, or ſpeake euill and maliciouſly of Chriſtian religion, as diuers and ſundrie wiſe prophane rich men offend, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the worthie name whereupon we are called: and whereby we are called.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb facs="tcp:19545:119"/> 2 As by their ſpeech, ſo by their liues men blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme and diſhonour the Goſpell, when they which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe religion: walke not, neither liue thereafter: by which meanes the Goſpell is flaundered, diſhonoured, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. <note place="margin">2. <hi>Kings</hi> 12.</note> Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> blaſphemed the worthy name whereby he was called, when by his adulterie he cauſed the name of God to be euill ſpoken of, and blaſphemed by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, the rulers ouer the people of Iſrael, cauſing them to houle, blaſphemed the name of God in like manner, as is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai</hi> 52.</note> witneſſed by the Prophet. The Iewes, which profeſſed the ſelues the people of GOD, by breaking the law of God (whereof they boaſted) and liuing in all vncleannes, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe <note place="margin">

All men profeſſing godlines, yet liuing diſorderly, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and otherwiſe farre then their calling requireth, blaſpheme the worthy name whereby they are called: as, adulterers, fornicators, vncleane perſons, couetous men, extortioners, oppreſſours, drunkards, vſurers, liers, decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, the malicious and enuious, the ſlaunderous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull perſons, with ſuch like, profeſſing godlines, but practiſing wickednes in their whole conuerſation: blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the name whereby they are called. And thus the rich men oftentimes blaſpheme the Goſpell in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>Albeit both wayes the worthy name whereby Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are called, be blaſphemed by the wicked rich men of the world: yet the Apoſtle ſeemeth to haue ſpoken of the former kinde, whereby the Goſpell is euill ſpoken of, and blaſphemed; as by the ſpitefull, malicious, and vile ſlaunders, mockings, and reproaches of Chriſt and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Which thing while the rich men of the world doe, they ought to be helde as curſed and execrable. To ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſuch as theſe are, what madnes is it?</p>
               <p>And as in the Apoſtles time there were ſuch hare-braines and frantike fooles; ſo this madnes alſo remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth among vs in theſe daies. For we cappe, we crouche, we bowe, we bende, we preferre, we honour, we eſteeme,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19545:119"/> we reſpect, and that with diſdaining of the poore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: vngodly men, mockers and ſcorners of religion: arrand papiſts: knowen adulterers: open blaſphemers: dayly liers: luxurious and riotous perſons: carnall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours: yea and profeſſed enemies vnto the Goſpell, and worthie name whereby wee are called: whoſe whole force is bent: whoſe whole laboure is imploied: whoſe ſtudie tendeth by all poſſible meanes, not onely in part to corrupt, but in whole to ſubuert Chriſtian religion: to bring in idolatrie, reſtore ſuperſtition, and ſowe the ſeede of ſciſme in the Church of Ieſus Chriſt. What mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is this in our braines: what phrenſie hath poſſeſſed vs: what lacke of ſenſe and reaſon, what doting follie hath bewitched vs? Theſe are then the two euils which in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepters of mens perſons, are here condemned: peruerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of iudgement in preferring the prophane rich, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God abhorreth: and contemning the poore godly, whom he hath called: and their doting madneſſe, in that they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and preferre thoſe, who for their tyrannie, vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and extreeme crueltie towards the Saints, and their horrible blaſphemie, whereby they blaſpheeme and ſpeake euill of the worthie name whereby we are called: are to be counted execrable and curſed. And this is the ſecond thing in this firſt reaſon to be conſidered: the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils which in reſpecters of perſons, in the profeſſing of the Goſpel of Chriſt, are here condemned.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The third thing in this firſt argument, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <note place="margin">The concluſion.</note> wherof thus ſaith the Apoſtle: but if ye fulfill the roiall lawe, according to the Scripture, you doe well: but if you regarde perſons, yee commit finne, and are reprooued of the lawe as tranſgreſſours. In which wordes the Apoſtle concludeth, that charitie which by the lawe of God is preſcribed: can not ſtande with this reſpect of perſons: for the lawe requireth, that men ſhoulde loue their neighbours as themſelues: without exception, counting all men our neighbours: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the dueties of loue men muſt not regarde mens perſons, but generally do their duetie to all, And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb facs="tcp:19545:120"/> ſeemeth to be inferred by the way of preuenting an obiection which might haue beene made by them which honour the rich with the contempt of the poore: for they might ſay: to honour is a point of loue: loue is the fulfilling of the law: therefore in honouring the rich, we fulfill the will and the lawe of God, and ſo doe well, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.</note> and offend not.</p>
               <p>Thereunto Saint <hi>Iames</hi> anſwereth: if in deede you loue according to the true meaning &amp; tenour of the law, which willeth vs to loue our neighbour as our ſelues, and counteth all men our neighbour: and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyneth loue generally towardes all to bee extended: you doe well. But if you regarde in your loue, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of men, and loue, honour, &amp; preferre men, becauſe of their riches, pompe, glorie, and outwarde appearance; you ſinne, and become tranſgreſſours of the law. If you loue euen the rich alſo as men, you do wel; but if you loue and honour them becauſe of their riches, you doe ſinne, and tranſgreſſe the law.</p>
               <p>This concluſion in theſe two verſes contayned, miniſtreth vnto vs the conſideration of foure things. 1 VVhat the royall lawe is, here mencioned. 2 Why this lawe is called a royall lawe. 3 VVhat this royall lawe commaundeth men. 4 Howe this lawe is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The lawe which here is called royall, is the lawe of loue and righteouſneſſe: preſcribing what duetie to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one pertaineth: and it containeth that part of the lawe, which in the ſecond table is deliuered: teaching vs to loue one without hating of another: to honour one, without contemning of another: to preferre one, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſdaine of another: to regarde the rich, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neglect of the poore brethren. The lawe of loue therefore, which preſcribeth what duetie is to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed to euerie one: is the royall lawe, by Saint <hi>Iames</hi> here mencioned.

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:19545:120"/> 2 This lawe of loue here called the royall lawe, is therefore called the royall lawe: 1 Becauſe it is from a King: not mortall but immortall: euen the king of kings and Lord of Lords, euen from God. This law then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from this King, is called the kings lawe the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 5.</note> lawe: the princely lawe. And that this lawe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning loue, is from GOD, it is manifeſt: for God in the reforming of his people, among other things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19.</note> this lawe vnto them: loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> agreeable thereunto ſayeth: Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning brotherly loue. I neede not to write vnto you: for <note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.</note> you are taught of God to loue one another. The lawe of loue therefore comming and proceeding from God the king of all kings and kingdomes of the earth, is therefore called royall, kingly, princely. 2 Becauſe it is the chiefe of all lawes, which concerne our dueties towardes our brethren, perſwading men, and drawing them to the o-obedience of the ſeconde table, which in perfourming of loue, is fulfilled. Therefore is loue ſo often called the fulfilling of the lawe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaieth, that the whole <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</note> law is briefly contained in this: loue the neighbour as thy ſelfe. To like effect in another place, to another Church he ſayeth: All the lawe is fulfilled in one worde, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.</note> which is this: loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe: And to his ſcholer <hi>Timothie,</hi> the end of the commandement is loue: <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.</note> out of a pure heart, and good conſcience, and faith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned. Seeing then the lawe of loue is as the chiefe, head, and as it were, the Queene, ouer other vertues and duties, and the onely thing wherein all the lawe of the ſeconde Table is contained, complete, and fulfilled: it maye therefore not amiſſe bee called royall or princely.</p>
               <p n="3">3 This law furthermore is called royall: becauſe it is like the kings high way: for as the kings high way is open for euerie man to paſſe therein, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth men from place to place foorth out right, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out turnings: So the lawe of GOD, which is the lawe of loue, is open, plaine, without turnings, of
<pb facs="tcp:19545:121"/> all men to bee gone in, trauailed, paſt through, not turning either to the right hande, or to the left, through reſpect of perſons: whereunto who ſo reſpecteth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth, turneth out of the high way, and wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth:</p>
               <p n="3">3 The law of loue being this roiall law, and for theſe cauſes ſo called: enioyneth men to loue their neighbours as themſelues. In which, three things may here briefly be obſerued. 1 What this law requireth: loue. 2 To whom: to our neighbour. 3 How? as to our ſelues.</p>
               <p>That Gods lawe requireth loue, who readeth the Scriptures, and ſeeth not? who peruſeth the word of god, and is ignorant? God himſelfe in the verie lawe, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19.</note> commaundeth, that men ſhould loue one another. Our Sauiour Chriſt, the very expounder of his fathers will vnto men: exhorteth all the Saints thereunto, as to the cognizance and liuerie, wherby they ſhould bee knowne to be his ſeruants. The Apoſtles the interpreters of this <note place="margin">

Saint <hi>John</hi> in his three Epiſtles, therein laboureth eſpecially to perſwade the Saints to follow loue. Of which in the time of his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching he was ſo carefull, that as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> recordeth, <note place="margin">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19545:121"/> loue.

               <p>The perſons whom we muſt loue, are our neighbors: thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe. But who is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19.</note> our neighbour? Our Sauiour Chriſt by the parable of the man falling into the handes of the theeues, betwixt <note place="margin">

               </argument>
               <p n="1">1 Of theſe three, the firſt is the propoſition, the ſtate of the matter, the ſetting downe of the thing which is in handling: and it is this: Whoſoeuer keepeth the whole lawe, yet offendeth or fayleth in one poynt thereof: hee is guiltie of all. Therefore that man which keepeth all the reſt of the lawe, and yet reſpecteth the perſonne of the prophaine riche man, and coptemneth the poore, godly, religious, and honeſt: is guiltie of all the whole lawe. Men cutting off from the lawe what ſeemeth them good, and keeping not the whole lawe indifferently: tranſgreſſe the law, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19545:123"/> offend againſt it. Such are they, which being by Gods law charged indifferently to loue all men, and count the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their neighbours: and in token of loue, honour ſome with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of others: as men reuerencing the wealthy though they be wicked, and diſdaining the poore Saintes and brethren. Theſe men therefore are guiltie of the whole lawe.</p>
               <p>But how is this true? Surely in as much as the law is ſo vnited and knitte together in euery part, as that who ſoeuer offendeth in one iote, is guiltie of all in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>How is he guiltie of the whole lawe, that faileth but in one point or part thereof? Two waies, 1 Who ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth all the whole law, yet by reſpecting the perſons of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, offendeth againſt loue, he is guiltie of the whole law: For loue is the fulfilling of the law. Who ſo offendeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that which conteineth all the reſt, and is the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the whole, is guiltie of the whole. Now the Scripture teacheth, that loue is the fulfilling of the lawe. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</note> For this, Thou ſhalt not committe adulterie, thou ſhalt not kill, thou ſhalt not ſteale, thou ſhalt not beare falſe witnes againſt thy neighbour: or if there bee any other law, it is briefly conteined in this; Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe. Our Sauiour Chriſt teacheth the ſaucie and malapert Lawier, which asked him a queſtion, not to learne of him, but to tempt him; That on thoſe two precepts of loue, thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with al <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 22.</note> thine heart, with all thy ſoule, with all thy minde: and thy neighbour as thy ſelfe, the whole law and the Prophetes dependeth Albeit then one obſerue all other parts of the law, yet offend againſt the law of loue, wherein the whole law is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſed, he is become guiltie of all, ſinning againſt that which conteineth all, which is loue.</p>
               <p n="2">2 A man obſeruing the whole law, yet offending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one point or parte thereof, is guiltie of the whole: becauſe no man can perfectly keepe any part of the lawe, as it ſhould be kept, which keepeth not the whole: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in failing in one iote of the law, men faile (as it were)
<pb facs="tcp:19545:124"/> in all, and are guiltie of all. For all the parts and precepts of the law are ſo knitte and vnited together in an inſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable coniunction: as that who ſo keepeth any one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, keepeth all: who ſo offendeth againſt any one, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth againſt all, and is guiltie of all.</p>
               <p>And is not this agreeable to <hi>Moſes</hi> doctrine, who holdeth all men vnder a bitter curſe, which obſerue not <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.</note> all the whole lawe of God? denouncing that curſe againſt euery particular offence, which is denounced againſt the breach of the whole lawe: and holding them vnder the ſame condemnation, that offended againſt any iote of the lawe: whereunto they are ſubiect which are guiltie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tranſgreſſions. To ſhew that men are counted guiltie before God of the whole law, which are found faulrie in any part thereof? Wherefore denouncing a curſe againſt many particular ſinnes, he concludeth his terrible curſe with theſe words; Curſed is euery one that perſeuereth not in all the words of this law, to doe them. Wherefore, how ſo euer men obſerue many parts of the lawe, yet if they obſerue not the whole: they are guiltie of the whole: and vnder the curſe and malediction which to the general breach of the law is threatened.</p>
               <p>Doth not our Sauiour teach, that vnleſſe we obſerue his whole doctrine, when we profeſſe him, and are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in his name: that it preuaileth little to obſerue ſome? <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.</note> when he bindeth all his ſeruants to the obedience of all that which he commaunded the Diſciples? Would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God geue vs ſo much to vnderſtand, when in his lawe hee bindeth vs ſo often to the obſeruation of the whole? Which thing to intimate vnto vs, the Apoſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that whoſoeuer obſerueth the whole law, yet fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in any point, is guiltie of all. A man therefore kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping all the whole lawe, beſide that one thing wherin he offendeth: is guiltie of the whole: and that no leſſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the breach of the law it ſelfe before God: then if he had offended in many points thereof: albeit he more greeuouſly (no doubt) offendeth, that offendeth in more precepts.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:19545:124"/>
               <p> Wherefore, as when a Prince enioyneth his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects the obſeruing of all his lawes and ordinances which he geueth them: if any one obſerue all the reſt, ſaue onely one, wherein he offendeth: the ſame is a breaker of the kings commaundement, and hath tranſgreſſed the law of his Prince, and is ſubiect to the penaltie which is threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the tranſgreſſion of the whole lawe: Euen ſo, God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning vs ſundrie precepts, &amp; willing vs to obſerue them all: If any man obſerue nine of the commaundementes, yet offende in the tenth: hee is a tranſgreſſor of the lawe, and is guiltie of the whole law: Whereunto full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience is enioyned.</p>
               <p>Thus they which obſerue all the reſt of the law, and yet offend in any one point: are held as tranſgreſſours of the whole lawe, whereof they are guiltie: for the law is as wel broaken in one, as in many offences: though not ſo greeuouſlie in one, as in many. And as a iudge, hauing twelue malefactors deſeruing like ſentence, to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in like manner, all whom the law requireth to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted: if he hang eleuen, and let the twelfe eſcape for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: he is an vniuſt, a wicked and corrupt iudge in that action, euen as if he ſaued foure, ſixe, or more: euen ſo, when men offend in one point of the lawe, though they obſerue all the reſt: they are guiltie of the whole: in as much as in one, as well as in many, it is broaken. Whereof the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> admoniſhing ſuch as wil be coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted iuſt, and obſeruers of the lawe, and yet haue the faith of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt in reſpect of perſons: prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth vnto them, that if they keepe all the reſt of the law of God, yet in this one thing, which is againſt loue, they fall away from duetie: they are guiltie of all.</p>
               <p>If he that keepeth the whole law, beſide that one thing wherein he offendeth: and in that one offending, be guiltie of the whole law: then it may ſeeme, that it is all one to offend in one, and in many precepts of the lawe: that it is like ſinne to tranſgreſſe in any one tittle or iote, and in the whole lawe: equall ſinne to breake one, and all the precepts and commandements of the law of God: and
<pb facs="tcp:19545:125"/> ſo all ſinnes may ſeeme alike and equall, as the Stoicall Philoſophers were of opinion.</p>
               <p>Hereunto be it anſwered, that the Apoſtle ſaith not; he that keepeth the whole law, and offendeth in one point thereof, is guiltie of the whole, in like manner, or alike, as if he had offended in the whole, and euery point thereof: but he is guiltie of the whole. Guiltie he is of the whole, who offendeth in one: but not ſo guiltie, nor ſo greeuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offending, as if he offended in euery point of the lawe. So that the Stoicall equalitie of ſinnes (that all ſinnes are like) may not herence be gathered, nor auouched.</p>
               <p>Which opinion of thoſe blockiſh, not Philoſophers in deede, but meere fooles rather, is hiſſed out of the Schoole of Chriſt. And as it may not herence be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: ſo may it diuerſly be confuted,</p>

               <p>Finally, Saint <hi>Iames</hi> this our Apoſtle, in this his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2 As of their cauſes ſinnes are iudged: ſo alſo they are iudged of their euents, ſinnes of malicious wickednes, thruſt out and expell the holy Ghoſt, and Spirit of God: ſo doe not ſinnes of infirmitie.

Whereby it appeared that their ſinnes were greater then the ſinnes of other men. And thus alſo may we iudge the inequality of ſinnes.</p>
               <p n="3">3 If we looke into the inequalitie of puniſhments, they alſo argue inequalitie of ſinnes: for it were againſt equitie and right to puniſh like ſinnes, in one more ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in another more ſlenderly.

Wherefore, to ſhew that the ſinnes of Princes are greater then the ſinnes of the people he ſaith; They which are moſt lowe, are worthie mercie, but the mightie ſhalbe mightely tormented. Our Sauiour Chriſt, the eternall wiſdome of God, by inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of puniſhments witneſſeth inequalitie of ſinnes vnto <note place="margin">

That ſinne ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which is puniſhed with many ſtripes, is the greater: that which with fewer, is the leſſe ſinne. In another place he ſetteth downe degrees of puniſhments, wherence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſinnes may be gathered.

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.</note> he that calleth him Racha, is worthie of a councel; who ſo calleth him foole, is worthy to bee puniſhed with hell fire. As then a councell is greater then iudgement, and hell fire then a councell: ſo is contempt (ſignified by Racha) greater ſinne then vnaduiſed anger: and ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and reproachfull ſpeach (by foole ſignified) greater <note place="margin">

Herence may it appeare, that the ſinne of Sodome was leſſe then the contempt of the Goſpel, becauſe our Sauiour auoucheth, that it ſhould be eaſier in the day of iudgement for the men of Sodome and Gomorrha, then for that Citie which receaued not the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Thus hee ſhewetb, that the ſinnes of Corazin and <note place="margin">

               <p> In that he therfore denounceth heauier iudgement againſt theſe Cities, then againſt Tyrus, Sydon, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doma: it appeareth that their ſinnes were the greater; &amp; ſo they were indeede, in reſpect of their knowledge of Gods will, and the manifolde myracles they had ſhewed them, to prouoke them, which were not done vnto Tyrus, Sidon, or Sodoma, the famous Cities. To like purpoſe, <note place="margin">

So that inequalitie of puniſhments, doth rightly argue inequalitie of offences.

Hauing this teſtimonie of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which by the inſtinct and light of nature is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, and impreſſed in mens hearts: it is euident that there is great difference and inequalitie of ſinnes.

               <p>This wee finde and knowe to bee moſt true, both in hyſtories ſacred, and alſo prophane: in common vſe and practiſe of our times: that ſome one ſinne ſo much more then others, haue diſquieted mens mindes: as that ſome therefore haue fallen phrentike: others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come deſperate: ſome haue beene dayly diſquieted, and haue languiſhed away: others haue beene the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of their owne bodies: whereby appeareth euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inequalitie of ſinne.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:19545:129"/> ſome ſinnes more trouble the conſciences of men then others do: ſeeing not onely Gods lawe, but mans alſo, forwarneth of one more then of another: ſeeing the verie Scripture of God affirmeth one to be greater then an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: then is the Stoicall opinion falſe, which holdeth an equalitie of all ſinnes. Neither is it the meaning here of the Apoſtle, to make all tranſgreſſions alike: as if it were al one to ſinne in one, and in many precepts: but to ſhew that the whole lawe is ſo vnited in euerie point, that who ſo breaketh one iot, breaketh all: and that no man can perfectly fulfill any one commaundement, which fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not all. And finally that the Maieſtie of God the lawmaker is offended in the breach of euerie commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, whoſe will and pleaſure is vnaccompliſhed, as well in one part of the lawe, as in manie: therefore ſaith he, who ſo euer keepeth the whole lawe, and yet faileth in one poynt, he is guiltie of all: and this is the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This propoſition of the Apoſtle, is in the ſeconde place confirmed: that hee that tranſgreſſeth in any one point of the lawe, is guiltie of the whole. And his reaſon or proofe is fetched from God, the authour and maker of the lawe: who, as he is alvvayes like himſelfe, and one; ſo hath hee vnited euerie part of the lawe in ſo narrowe and ſtreight coniunction: as that hee that offendeth in anie one poynt, breaketh all, and is guiltie of the whole. For one and the ſame God, which forbiddeth commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of adulterie, forbiddeth alſo the committing of murther: So that if we commit not adulterie, yet if wee commit murther, we haue tranſgreſſed the lawe. He that forbiddeth theft, forbiddeth alſo falſe witneſſe. If wee ſteale not, yet beare falſe witneſſe agaynſt our brethren, wee haue tranſgreſſed the lawe. The ſame God forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth drunkenneſſe, which alſo forbiddeth wantonneſſe: If therefore we be not wanton, yet bee drunken, we are tranſgreſſours of the whole lawe. To be ſhort, the ſame God which commaundeth one thing, commaundeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:19545:129"/> another: hee that forbiddeth one ſinne, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth alſo another: So that if a man ſeeme to keepe the whole lawe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat onelie part wherein hee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth excepted, and therein fayleth: hee is guiltie of all.</p>
               <p>Wherehence then it followeth, that if men keepe all the reſt of the lawe, beſides this one thing: that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth the perſons of men, and ſo offende agaynſt the lawe of loue: hee ſinneth agaynſt the lawe, and is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all the whole lawe: becauſe hee that commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the other partes of the lawe, commaundeth this alſo: ſo that his will is broken in one, as well as in many poynts of the lawe. Thus the Apoſtle reaſoneth from the authour of the lawe, who willeth that euerie part thereof be obſerued.</p>
               <p>VVhat ſayeth ſome man: is hee that preferreth the prophane rich man, before the poore godly perſon, and therein offending, guiltie of the ſinne of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, murther, blaſphemie, vnlawfull luſt, concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcenſe, couetouſneſſe and the reſt? Or committeth he all the ſinnes in the lawe forbidden, which committeth one onely ſinne, and therein offendeth?</p>
               <p>No aſſuredly. But becauſe the breach of one title of the lawe, is the turning away from the will of GOD, the lawe maker: whoſe will is tranſgreſſed in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of anie one duetie: therefore hee which offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in one poynt, is helde as guiltie of the whole lawe. Such therefore as regarde the perſons of the rich, with diſdainefull contempt of the poore: tranſgreſſe the lawe therein, and are guiltie of the whole lawe: if wee reſpect the Maieſtie of God, which is hurt as well in the breach of one, as of many precepts, albeit (as hath beene ſaid) not ſo grieuouſly.</p>
               <p>VVhich is here ſet downe by the Apoſtle, leaſt anie ſhoulde ſeeme to flatter and excuſe himſelfe, or vaunt himſelfe for guiltleſſe, when hee obſerueth all the reſt of the lawe; yet in anie iot thereof offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19545:130"/>
               <p> Wherefore (as if the Apoſtle ſhoulde ſay) let vs graunt that in manie things you obſerue and keepe the lawe, and therein offende not: yet can you not denie, but that in preferring the wicked wealthie rich men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the godly poore brethren: you haue the fayth of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in reſpect of perſons: in doing whereof, his will is broken, who hath commaunded the reſt of the lawe: and ſo you are guiltie of the whole lawe. For hee that commaundeth one thing in the lawe, commaundeth another: he that commaundeth we ſhould not commit adulterie, commaundeth alſo, that wee ſhoulde not kill: whereof, in whether ſoeuer we offende, his lawe is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: his will and pleaſure tranſgreſſed: therefore there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in offending, wee are guiltie of the whole lawe of God. Thus the Apoſtle by this reaſon drawne from example of the partes of the lawe, vvhich are all enioyned by the ſame lavv-maker vvhich is God: proueth the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: vvho ſo euer keepeth the vvhole lavve, and fayleth in one point, is guiltie of all. For hee that ſaide, thou ſhalt not commit adulterie, ſaide alſo, thou ſhalt not kill: vvherefore if thou commit not adulterie, yet if thou kill: thou art a tranſgreſſour of the lavve. Theſe thinges beeing ſo manifeſt, vve need no further to dilate this matter: this for the proofe of a thing ſo plaine, being ſufficient.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The thirde and laſt thing in this ſeconde reaſon, is the concluſion, in the 12. and 13. verſes contained. In vvhich concluſion there are tvvo things to bee noted. 1 The concluſion it ſelfe. 2 The reaſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
               <p>This concluſion, is as an exhortation: ſo ſpeake, and ſo doe, as they vvhich ſhall bee iudged by the lavve of libertie. VVhereby vvee are aduertiſed, that ſuch as vvill be exempted and cleared from the curſe of the lavv: muſt both ſo ſpeake and ſo doe, as they vvhich hope to bee iudged by the lavve of libertie: In all our doings, in all our ſayings, in all our actions, in all our ſpeeches, ſo to conforme our ſelues to the nouriſhing of loue:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19545:130"/> as they which hope thereby to bee abſolued from death and damnation. Wherefore it is good to bewarie and charie both in our doings, and in our ſayings alſo: that neither in the one, neither in the other, wee fall away from perfourming of duetie of loue one to another: which care who ſo euer neglecteth: ſhall not taſte of the grace of God, who hath in ſingular loue, and tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie deliuered vs from the curſe of the lawe eſpecially vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition, that as thereby wee are partakers of his vnſpeakable loue: ſo wee ſhould in like manner cheeriſh and maintaine charitie among our ſelues, wherunto this partiall preferring of perſons is contrarie.</p>
               <p>By the lawe of libertie, ſome vnderſtand the law of loue: which therefore is called the lawe of libertie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe through loue wee are deliuered from ſinnes: for that our ſinnes and iniquities are couered before God, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. <hi>Pro.</hi> 10.</note> when we ſhewe the manifeſt tokens of loue towardes our brethren. And by this lawe men are ſaide to bee iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, becauſe in the generall iudgement, ſentence ſhall be giuen eyther with vs, or agaynſt vs, by the fruites of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 15.</note> our loue. If wee ſhall ſhewe vnfeigned loue towardes Chriſt in his afflicted members: in feeding them, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie: in refreſhing them, thirſtie: in harbouring them, ſtraungers: in clothing them, naked: in viſiting them, ſicke: in ſeeing them, impriſoned: then ſhall we heare ſentence of comfort: Come yee bleſſed of my father: receyue the Kingdome prepared for you from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the worlde. But if we ſhewe no loue by theſe: then ſhall wee heare ſentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Go you curſed of my Father into euerlaſting fire, prepared for the diuell and his angels. Thus accot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe teſtimonies of faith, and fruites of loue, wee shall bee iudged. Howſoeuer this bee true: yet the lawe of libertie maie rather heere ſignifie the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> 1. <hi>Chapter verſe</hi> 25.</note> Goſpell it ſelfe: or the mercie of GOD, in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell preached vnto men: and the Goſpel or mercie of God, may therefore be called the law of libertie becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:19545:131"/> they which are effectually partakers thereof, are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deliuered from the curſe of the lawe: from dreade of death; from power of Satan; from ſlauerie of ſinne; and tranſlated into the glorious libertie of the ſonnes of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> God.</p>
               <p>And here to bee iudged, is to bee diſcharged, quitte, deliuered, and abſolued from death and damnation: as the place it ſelfe may import vnto vs; ſo doe, and ſo ſpeake, as they which ſhall bee iudged by the lawe of libertie: that is ſuch as truſt by the mercie of God to be deliuered from death and damnation.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this exhortatorie concluſion is: there ſhall bee condemnation mercileſſe vnto him that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no mercie; and mercie reioyceth agaynſt condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Such as in diſdayning and contemning the poore, and preferring the rich, beeing prophane and wicked, ſhewe themſelues mercileſſe and voyde of loue: ſhall themſelues taſte, not of mercie, but of iudgement; not of loue, but of the wrath of GOD: but they which in this poynt fulfill the royall lawe of GOD, commaunding men to loue their neighbours as themſelues; and ſo ſhevve themſelues mercifull, euen tovvardes the poore brethren: they ſhall triumph ouer iudgement and condemnation, vvhereunto they ſhal not be ſubiect.</p>
               <p>This thing, as in the propoſed matter it is moſt true: ſo in other officices and dueties, it is no leſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: for generally vvho ſo is of an hard heart, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, curriſh and cruell towarde men: ſhall finde God ſeuere, rough, &amp; ſharpe againſt himſelf. For mercy ſhalbe reſtrained from thoſe which ſhew no mercie, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or condemnation mercileſſe, ſhal be to them which ſhewe no mercie. If in Chriſtian aſſemblies, men preferre the rich with mercileſſe contempt of the poore brethren: Almightie God in the aſſemblie of his Saints, and in the meeting together of thouſands and ten thouſands of his angels: ſhal neglect &amp; diſdaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>If we geue by hard meaſure of raſh and cruel iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee ſhall reape, and receaue againe by the like. Wherefore our Sauiour Chriſt exhorteth men not raſhlie to iudge or condemne: leaſt they be likewiſe iudged and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.</note> condemned: for with what meaſure we meate vnto other men, it ſhall bee meaſured with the like vnto vs againe: which is the iuſt iudgement of God againſt men, in the whole courſe of their liues.</p>
               <p>Such then as are mercileſſe, and nouriſh not loue,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:132"/> ſhall not only not obteine mercie, but cannot aske mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie at the hands of GOD or man. For with what face, what looke, what countenance can they aske that, which they haue denied to others? Yea, experience and vſe of things doe plentifully teach vs, that mercie ſhalbe denied the mercileſſe: and condemnation without pittie, ſhewed vpon them which ſhew no mercie.</p>
               <p>Haue we not ſeene many pinched with pouertie, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with famine, eaten with noyſome diſeaſes, ſpoiled of their wealth, robbed of their riches, vexed in their mindes, tormented in their bodies, afflicted on euerie ſide: who in the daies of their flouriſhing wealth, in the ſoundnes and health of their bodies, and quietnes of their mindes, haue beene merciles towardes ſuch, as in this wiſe were afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Hath not condemnation, execution, puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, been merciles towardes them, for that they ſhewed no mercie? This is therefore generally in al things, particularly true, in hauing the faith of our glorious Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in reſpect of perſons, that there ſhalbe condemnation mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles ſhewed vnto them which ſhew no mercie.</p>
               <p>The oppoſite and contrarie member hereunto is, mercie reioyceth againſt condemnation: for they which are mercifull, ſhall finde fauour, grace and mercie, before the iudgement ſeate of God, and reioyce ouer condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which through the grace of God they ſhal eſcape: in as much as by their loue, and fruites of mercie, they ſhewe themſelues truely inſerted and ingraffed into the body of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> Ieſus Chriſt, whereby they are exempted and freed from condemnation: For there is now no condemnation vnto thoſe that are in Ieſus Chriſt, which walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirite. Theſe being made by the mercy of God, the liuely members of the body of Ieſus Chriſt: theſe being the children of the reſurrection: theſe beeing the heires of the grace of god: theſe being the iointheires with Ieſus Chriſt: theſe (by their vnfeined loue) ſhewing themſelues the faithfull and vndoubted Saints: ſhall not come into condemnation, neither ſee death: neither feare they the ſeueritie of Gods iudgements, (as doe the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,

               <p n="1">1 Now to proceed vnto theſe thinges as they lie in the Apoſtle. The firſt is the Propoſition, whereof thus ſaith the Apoſtle; What auaileth it though a man ſay hee hath faith, when he hath no workes? Can his faith ſaue him? As if he would ſay; That faith which is void and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of good workes, as fruites, effects, and tokens of a faith: is not to be reputed and taken for a true, ſauing and iuſtifying faith: but rather for a ſhew and ſhadow of faith, then for faith indeede: for that no man is iuſtified and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by faith before GOD: whoſe faith in due time, and in conuenient manner, ſheweth not it ſelfe in the fruites and dueties of loue.</p>
               <p>A doctrine moſt wholeſome, moſt needfull, moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, moſt profitable: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyning a moſt graue diſcourſe of the fruites of ſanctification in al the elect of god, againſt ſuch as make ſhew of faith, without godlines: wherin men are taught that the very profeſſion of Gods word, &amp; chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, profiteth nothing: vnleſſe it be ioyned with the ſtudie of good works, whereby our faith is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt vnto men.</p>
               <p>This matter and argument is often vrged againſt the ſhameleſſe hypocrites of all times, who pretend religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19545:134"/> in outward appearance: but practiſe not true holines, whereby their religion might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed: as both in the former Chapter towards the end, and from this place to the knitting vp of this preſent Chapter.

Finally, hereunto ſerue al the exhortations in holy Scripture, whereby the men of God moue vs to the practiſe of obedience, and ſtudie of vertue in the whole courſe of our life: which is the onely &amp; ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall drift in the Apoſtles diſcourſe here ſet downe, as is manifeſtly apparant.</p>
               <p>Albeit then men by their workes deſerue not life, ne yet purchaſe their ſaluation by their deedes: but with god are iuſtified onely through faith in Ieſus Chriſt, as the whole body of Scriptures, the examples of Fathers, the teſtimonies of the learned Doctors of the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme: yet are good workes ſo neceſſarie in thoſe which are once iuſtified by faith before God: as that where they are not, faith is dead and fruitleſſe: yea, a ſhadow of faith rather then faith it ſelfe, whereby men are iuſtified and ſaued before God. Which thing the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> to intimate, in his affirmance here auoucheth; What auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19545:134"/> it my brethren, though a man ſay he hath faith, when he hath no workes? Can his faith ſaue him?</p>
               <p>That faith, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is without good works, is not ſuch a faith, as whereby we are iuſtified and ſtand before God: but a fruiteleſſe, dead, and barraine faith, whereof we boaſt in vaine. For, outward profeſſion without holy conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is halting hypocriſie: and pretended religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true reformation, is double iniquitie. This is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of holy Scripture, this is the ſtate and propoſition of this preſent Treatiſe: this is the thing carefully &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually preached by the Miniſters and Preachers of the goſpel now receiued: yet our aduerſaries, to bring vs into odious and hatefull contempt with men, with batter back<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>biting, and reproachfull ſlaunder, ſay; We preach libertie to ſinne: we lay looſe the raignes in the neckes of men, to all iniquitie: we geue licence to all licenciouſnes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie. when we preach that good workes are neceſſarie in all thoſe which are iuſtified: partly to ſet forth Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: partly to ſhew and expreſſe our vnfeyned faith; partlie to winne others by vertuous example, to godlines: preach we liberty? when we teach, that faith voide of good works, when time, place, perſons, and other occaſions and circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſerue: is vaine, fruitleſſe, and barraine: Teach wee licentiouſnes to ſinne? when we crie againſt the vain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of men, careleſſe of the dueties of loue: Laye wee the raines looſe in the neckes of men, to runne he adlong into their owne deſtruction? when we auouch that euerie one which calleth vpon Chriſt, muſt depart from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Geue we bitte and bridle to iniquitie? Finally, when we all with one mouth and one mind, crie out againſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball religion, which is onely in word: and driue men to the practiſe of pure and holy obedience, if they will euer looke to inherite the kingdome of heauen: Doe wee (like heretikes) ſwerue from the trueth, and not rather agree &amp; meet iuſt with Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his doctrine: who affirmeth, that men in ſaying they haue faith, when they haue no workes, auaile nothing: neither that ſuch a faith can ſaue them</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19545:135"/>
               <p> The Propoſition of the Apoſtle therefore is this. If a man ſay he hath faith, when he hath no workes, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth nothing, neither can that faith ſaue him. In which propoſition, and Apoſtolick affirmance, is liuely ſet down vnto men, the neceſſitie of good workes, and fruites of ſanctification.</p>
               <p>This Propoſition is prooued from the fifteene verſe to the ſixe and twentie, by foure reaſons: Wherof two are <note place="margin">1. <hi>Is the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmation of the place.</hi>
                  </note> in theſe words of the Apoſtle, to the nineteene, or rather to the twentie verſe conteined. The firſt from a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in the fifteene, ſixteene, ſeuenteene, eighteene verſes compriſed. The ſeconde in the nineteen verſe deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Reaſon, why faith (bringing not forth good works) cannot ſaue men, neither auaileth any thing: is from a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude. In which reaſon three thinges muſt be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. 1 The ſimilitude it ſelfe. 2 The application of the ſimilitude. 3 The preuenting of an obiection.</p>
               <p>The ſimilitude in theſe words is expreſſed. If a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or ſiſter be naked, or deſtitute of dayly foode, &amp; one of you ſay vnto them; Depart in peace, warme your ſelues, fil your bellies: notwithſtanding you geue them not thoſe things which are needfull to the bodie: what helpeth it? For a man to ſay to the hungrie, goe fill thy bellie: to the thirſtie, goe drinke: to the naked, goe apparrell and cloath thy ſelfe: to the harborleſſe, get thee lodging: yet geueth nothing at all whereby they may doe ſo: For hee neither geueth meate to feede him; nor drink to refreſh him; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloath to couer him; nor houſeroome to harbor him: This bidding the hungrie to fill his bellie; the naked to warme him; the thirſtie to refreſh himſelfe; the harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to get himſelfe lodging, is no true charitie, nor ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d loue: but charitie in ſhew, loue in word, which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> condemneth: My little children, let vs not loue in worde, neither in tongue onely; but in deede and in trueth: For Chriſtian charitie, and pure loue, ſtandeth not in wordes, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.</note> but in deedes, and proceedeth from a pure and ſincere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:19545:135"/>
               <p> For a man to ſay to him that hath purſe pennileſſe: bodie cloathleſſe: ſcrippe meatleſſe: remaining harbourleſſe: go get thee meat: go cloath thy backe: go fill thy bagge: go lodge thy ſelfe, maketh ſhew onely of falſe liberalitie. If a Surgeon ſay to the wounded perſon, get thee ſalue and heale thy ſelfe: yet giueth him neither ſalue nor plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, nor any thing whereby his ſore may be healed: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth but ſlenderly. A phiſitian bidding his cure and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to waxe ſtrong: to recouer health: to walke abroad: and yet applieth nothing, neither preſcribeth any thing whereby ſtrength may be gotten, health recouered, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtate reſtored, by bare wordes profiteth nothing. He that meeteth a wayfairing man, farre from al path or high way, wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring; and ſaith, go aright: yet teacheth not which hand he muſt turne on, which way he muſt take, which path he muſt follow; helpeth the ſtaier nothing towardes his propoſed iourney. To bid the hungrie go fill his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and yet to giue him nothing, is no charitie: to will the naked to cloath himſelfe, and miniſter not whereby that may be accompliſhed, is no liberalitie: for the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon to perſwade the wounded man to cure himſelfe, teaching not whereby he may do it, is no pitie: for the Phiſition to exhort his pacient, to recouer helpe and health, and preſcribe not whereby the ſickeneſſe may be repelled, and former ſtate reſtored; is no remedie: to bidde a man keepe the right way, when hee is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out, and not to ſet him in the path hee muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, is no courteſie. Thus by this ſimilitude, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle sheweth, that that is no faith which is in wordes onely.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The application of this ſimilitude is the ſeconde thing in this firſt argument and reaſon: thus by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle expreſſed: as to ſay to the hungrie: goe fill thy bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: and to the naked, goe warme thy ſelfe, and giue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereby his hunger may bee ſlaked, and his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe couered, and his bodie warmed; is no libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in deede: ſo neyther fayth is to bee counted fayth in deede, when it is voyde of good workes. Euen ſo
<pb facs="tcp:19545:136"/> ſaieth Saint <hi>James,</hi> the faith if it haue no workes is dead in it ſelfe. Such faith therefore as bringeth not foorth good fruites, and is plentifull in good workes: is not true fayth, but an image of fayth: is not a liuely fayth, but a certaine deade thing, ſet out by the name of fayth: euen as to ſay to the hungrie, go fill thy bellie, is no charitie.</p>
               <p>A true fayth, by the workes of loue is quickened, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued, and receyueth, as it were, life, in the ſight and ſhew of men. Wherefore that fayth which is deſtitute here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is as deade, and not to be accounted of. For, as when we ſee our brethren naked, deſtitute of dayly foode: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and diſtreſſed on euery ſide: and ſay to them, God helpe you poore men, God comfort you, go in the name of God, and prouide for your ſelues, yet wee giue them nothing: this our ſpeach argueth not true liberalitie and charitie: euen ſo when we ſay wee haue fayth, and yet ſhewe no deedes, whereby our fayth may bee knowen vnto men: thus to boaſt of fayth: thus to ſay wee haue faith: thus to pretende that wee doe beleeue, doth not argue true faith: for faith ſaieth <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> without <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hom.</hi> 8. <hi>vpon</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi>
                  </note> workes, is a figure, ſhewe or image without force or vertue. VVhereof to boaſt, is to boaſt of a dead thing, wherein is no quickeneſſe, no life, no profitableneſſe to men: and to incurre iuſt reproofe, and open reprehenſion with the worlde.</p>
               <p>The bare name and profeſſion of faith, which hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and the common ſort of men count and call faith: which by a kinde of correction and graunting may be ſo called: when men pretende in wordes that they beleeue, and in outward appearance profeſſe themſelues to haue faith, which we may graunt to bee a kinde of faith: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute and voide of good workes, is in deed vaine and dead: neither deſerueth it the name of faith more then a dead man, deſerueth to be called a man: yet ſo men call him ſometimes: or the image of Caeſar, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Caeſar: or the picture of King <hi>Henrie</hi> deſerueth to bee called the King. Which names, if we applie to theſe
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:19545:136"/> things, wee ſpeake vnproperly, as to call a deade man, a man: or <hi>Caeſars</hi> image, <hi>Caeſar;</hi> or King <hi>Henrie</hi> his picture, King <hi>Henrie:</hi> ſo when we call this dead faith, faith: wee ſpeake vnproperly.</p>
               <p>If a man (ſaieth he) hath faith, and that he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: yet is mercileſſe, cruell, couetous, reprochfull, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, riotous, vniuſt, vnrighteous, vngodly, an oppreſſour, extorcioner, vſurer, murtherer, drunkard, proud perſon, or caried away with any ſuch like ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie and ſinne, from the ſtudie and practiſe of good workes: can that fayth ſaue him? Can that faith bee counted ſuch a fayth, as whereby before GOD wee are iuſtified? Or may wee not rather ſay, that fayth quai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, dyeth, and is decaied in him? Which men may graunt to bee fayth in a ſpeach vnproper: but not ſuch a faith as is accepted with GOD, through Ieſus Chriſt. Euen as that was no liberalitie, neither is it, for a man to ſay to the hungrie, go fill thy bellie: and to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, go warme thy ſelfe: and yet to giue them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing needefull for the bodie: but rather a mocking, both of the diſtreſſed, and of GOD himſelfe: vppon whome the contumelies, reproches, iniuries, redounde, which are done to his Saints, afflicted in this world, and diſcuſſed.</p>
               <p>For as the poore is after a manner mocked, when in wordes wee ſeeme to moane him, and for his caſe to bee mooued: when notwithſtanding we ſhewe no fruites of compaſſion: ſo is God alſo after a manner mocked, when we pretende wee haue fayth, yet ſhewe foorth no good workes, whereby our fayth in God might bee teſtified, and the afflicted Saintes comforted: and ſo our fayth is but deade in vs. For what the ſoule is to the bodie, that is Charitie and the fruites of loue vnto fayth. And wee knowe that the ſoule quickeneth and giueth life vnto the bodie, whereby it is diſcerned and knowne from a dead bodie: ſo charitie and the dueties of loue giue life vnto our faith, and maketh it knowen to bee liuelie, quicke and fruitfull. So then as the bodie is
<pb facs="tcp:19545:137"/> dead without the ſoule: ſo is faith deade without good workes which giue life, as it were, and quickeneth it, in the ſight of men. And what health is to this bodily life, the ſame are fruites of charitie, and ſanctification to the faith of each man and woman. Nowe health giueth ſtrength to the legges, might to the armes, power to the bodie, conuenient abilitie to euerie member, for the perfourmance of actions in this bodie and preſent ſtate of life, required: euen ſo vnfeigned loue, reformed life, the fruites of ſanctification, the ſtudie of vertue and good workes: maketh our ſoules nimble, and our fayth ſtrong to perfourme thoſe dueties, which of the Saints, iuſtified by faith in Ieſus Chriſt: are expected, looked for, and required.</p>
               <p>If fayth and workes in Gods Saints be ſo neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ioyned, and ſo inſeparably vnited and knit together, as that without good workes, faith is here counted dead: and iuſtification before GOD bee imputed to fayth, as the Scripture teacheth: <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued, and it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gene.</hi> 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> vnto him for righteouſneſſe: howe shall not iuſtification be imputed to workes alſo, ſeeing they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable?</p>
               <p>It may be anſwered: that faith and good workes in the Saints of God now iuſtified, are inſeparable, but to the obtaining of iuſtification, fayth without workes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is required, and all workes excluded from the worke of iuſtification. Therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, that by the workes of the lawe no flesh is iuſtified in the ſight of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</note> God: and that all haue ſinned, and are depriued of the glorie of God, &amp; are iuſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Ieſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet foorth to bee a reconciliation through fayth in his blood. A little after making an Antithiſis, and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> betwixt faith and workes, ſo that they cannot any wiſe agree in the worke of our iuſtification: he ſayth, to him that worketh, the wages is not counted by fauour, but by debt. But to him that worketh not, but beelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth on him that inſtifieth the vngodly: his fayth is <note place="margin">

                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:19545:137"/> counted for righteouſneſſe. In the ſame Epiſtle long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee reaſoneth in like manner from things oppoſed one to the other, whereof both cannot be cauſes of the ſame effects, and ſo beateth flat to the ground all works, from being either in whole, or in part, cauſe of our iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: if election (and iuſtification) be of grace, then is it no more of workes, for elſe were grace no more grace: but if it bee of workes, then is it not of grace, for then were worke no more worke. To the Church of Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.</note> know that a man is not iuſtified by the workes of the lawe, but by the fayth of Ieſus Chriſt. This doctrine hee publiſhed to his ſcholer <hi>Titus,</hi> the Biſhop of the Iſle of Creta: wherefore he ſaith in this wiſe: when that bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of that loue of God our Sauiour towards man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.</note> not by the workes of righteouſneſſe, which wee had done, but according to his mercie he ſaued vs. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, to the Church of Epheſus: By grace are you ſaued <note place="margin">

               <p>If our aduerſaries replie, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the ceremoniall law, when he excludeth workes from iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying vs: I anſwere: that hee ſpeaketh not of the lawe ceremoniall onely, but of the morall lawe alſo: ſo that no workes iuſtifie vs, but all are excluded from that worke, before God.</p>
               <p>And this may thus appeare. 1 When <hi>Paul</hi> woulde <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</note> prooue that both Iewe and Gentile are vnder ſinne, and ſo neither by their workes iuſtified before God: he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth many teſtimonies out of the Prophets, <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Iſai:</hi> whereby all men are conuinced of ſinne: as, there is none righteous, no not one: there is none that ſeeketh after God: there is none that hath vnderſtanding: they haue all gone out of the way, they haue beene made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnprofitable: there is none that doth good, no not one. There throte is an open ſepulchre: they haue
<pb facs="tcp:19545:138"/> vſed their tongues to deceyte, the poiſon of Aſpes is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their lippes: and ſo forth, from the 10. verſe, to the 19. verſe. In the twentieth verſe vpon thoſe former teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies hee inferreth: therefore by the workes of the lawe ſhall no fleſh be iuſtified in his ſight. His concluſion muſt holde in the ſame workes, whereof in the proofe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes he ſpoke: but his teſtimonies are touching the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law, not the ceremoniall law: &amp; therefore ſpeaketh he alſo of the moral law, when he excludeth workes from iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying vs in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In that place: why we, nor any fleſh, can by any meanes be iuſtified by the workes of the lawe: the reaſon <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 20</note> of the Apoſtle is this: for by the law commeth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſinne. Wherehence I draw this argument: by thoſe workes of the law whereby we haue knowledge of ſinne, no fleſh is iuſtified before GOD. But by the works of the morall lawe we haue greateſt knowledge of ſinne: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euen the workes of the lawe morall, are excluded from the worke of iuſtification. And that the moral lawe bringeth knowledge of ſinne chiefly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewed to the Romanes. VVho in another place repeating the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom</hi> 7.</note> ſame, that knowledge of ſinne commeth by the lawe: he giueth inſtance, not in the part ceremoniall, but in the part morall, of the lawe: I knewe not ſinne (ſayeth hee) but by the lawe: for I had not knowne luſt, except the lawe had ſaide, thou ſhalt not luſt. If the workes of that lawe, whereby the knowledge of ſinne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, iuſtifie no fleſh: and the chiefe knowledge of ſinne come by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lawe: then doe not the woorkes of the morall lawe iuſtifie more, then the workes of the ceremoniall lawe of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That lawe, whoſe workes Saint <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth from being meanes of mans iuſtification, cauſeth wrath: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> as in the ſame diſputation is auouched: but to cauſe wrath is not proper to the ceremonies of the law, which were rather giuen to reconcile the people to God: but to the morall lawe, which thundereth out the fearful wrath <note place="margin">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:19545:138"/> not the ceremonies, but neither the morall workes of the law do iuſtifie vs before God.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Finally, S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Church of Galatia hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſame argument and queſtion of iuſtification: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.</note> and therin prouing that vve art not iuſtified by the works of the lavve, he reaſoneth from contraries: by the lavve vve are held accurſed: therefore thereby vvee are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and iuſtified. His antecedent or former propoſition he proueth by the lavve it ſelfe, vvherein it is thus vvrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: Curſed is euery one, that continueth not in all <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.</note> things, that are vvritten in the lavv to do them. Novv this curſe is not ſo much vnderſtood of the breach of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, as of the moral precepts: to the tranſgreſſion, vvhereof, from 15. verſe, to 26. verſe, ſetting dovvne ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall curſes, as againſt idolatry, diſobedience of children to their parents: remouing of land markes, vvhereunder he condemneth all iniuries and extortions: not counſelling and helping our neighbour: hindering the right of the ſtraunger, fatherleſſe and vvidovv: inceſt, buggerie, priuy hurt, briberie. 36. verſe, he concludeth: Curſed (ſaith he) is euerie one that abideth not in all things that are vvrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this booke to do them. Citing therefore that place in the matter &amp; queſtion of iuſtification, vvhich he appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to faith: &amp; altogether taketh fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> works, ſpeaketh not of the ceremonies of the lavv only, but of the moral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts alſo: &amp; ſo of all the vvorks of the lavv: vvhich both in vvhole and in part are denied to iuſtifie vs before God.</p>
               <p>Albeit this controuerſie betvvixt the Ievves and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 9.</note> the Apoſtles, began about circumciſion, vvhich the Ievves vvould haue annexed to faith &amp; the Goſpel, as neceſſarie to euery one which ſhould be ſaued, as appeareth: yet the Apoſtle riſing from the part to the vvhole: from circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion to all the lavve of <hi>Moiſes:</hi> excludeth not only cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, but all the vvorkes of the lavve, from iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying vs before God.</p>
               <p>It follovveth not therefore becauſe faith and vvorks are both in gods Saints togither; therfore they haue the ſame effect, namely to iuſtifie before God. For albeeit
<pb facs="tcp:19545:139"/> man hath at once, feete, handes, eares and eyes, yet fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not that they ſerue to one vſe, but to ſeuerall: the feete to walke: the handes to touch: the eares to heare: the eyes to ſee: ſo albeit in the Saints there is both faith and good workes: yet by faith, not by workes, are we ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and iuſtified before GOD. In the Sunne there are together both heate and light, yet is not the light, but the heate and influence, cauſe of the bringing foorth of earthly creatures, and fruites of the ground: and by the light, not by the heate, it shineth vnto men. In the Element of water, naturally there is moyſture ioyned with colde: yet to purge and wash is proper to the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, not to the colde: to coole, proper to the coldneſſe rather, then to the moyſture. So in like manner, albeit fayth and good woorkes bee in the Saints at once, yet are men iuſtified by faith and beleefe, not by woorkes: which in deede are not good, but in as much as we are iuſtified by faith in Chriſt, from whence, as fruites from a tree, they ſpring vnto men, and are manifeſt to the worlde: by order and conſideration faith going before as the cauſe, gendering good woorkes as effects in the Saints of God.</p>
               <p>To applie iuſtification to workes as well as to faith, is a deceit and fallacie from the accident, in applying that to one, which is proper to another, becauſe both are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together. Saint <hi>Origen</hi> vpon the 3. Rom. sheweth that faith alone without works ſaueth, whereof he giueth the theefe for exemple, and the woman to whom Chriſt ſaid, thy ſins are forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee, thy faith hath made thee whole. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Origen in Rom.</hi> 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now that we ſay, faith and workes are ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo inſeparablie, as that faith without workes is dead, according to this infallible doctrine, in them which are alreadie iuſtified it is true: not ſimplie. For in men to be iuſtified they are not: for in them, firſt faith is, whereby they are iuſtified, and afterwardes good workes follow. In the poore publican there were no good works: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 18.</note> but faith was in him, whereby moued, he hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled himſelfe &amp; ſaid: O God be merciful vnto me a ſinner: &amp; ſo deſtitute
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19545:139"/> of workes, he departed iuſtified. The theefe, who through <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 23.</note> faith intreated our Sauiour Chriſt, that he would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him when he came to his kingdome: thereby was iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified: yet had no good workes apparant, with his faith. Faith therefore in men to be iuſtified, is without workes: but being once iuſtified, workes (as ſoone as occaſion is miniſtred) ſhew themſelues in the Saints of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this doctrine. Truely therefore ſaith Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine;</hi> When the Apoſtle ſaith: wee ſuppoſe, or conclude, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Defide &amp; ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus. c.</hi> 14.</note> that a man is iuſtified by faith without the works of the lawe: he doeth it not, that men profeſſing and obteining faith, ſhould deſpiſe the workes of righteouſnes: but that euery man might know, that by faith he may be iuſtified. And writing to <hi>Sixtus</hi> the prieſt, he ſaith; The Saints haue <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 105. <hi>Sixto.</hi>
                  </note> good works, in as much as they are iuſtified: but to bee made righteous, they haue none.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Honoratus</hi> hee ſpeaketh in like manner; Good <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 120. <hi>Honorato.</hi>
                  </note> workes beginne after that we are iuſtified: but we are not therefore iuſtified, becauſe good works went before iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus muſt we wiſely diſtinguiſh times and perſons: the time before iuſtification, when faith is alone: from the time when we are iuſtified, at what time, faith and workes are ioyned together. The perſons to be iuſtified, in whom faith only is required: fom theſe which are iuſtified alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in whom, (beſides faith) good workes muſt alſo ſhine and flouriſh. For they, together with faith, receaue alſo the holy Ghoſt, and Spirite of ſanctification, as ſaint <hi>Luke</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 44. <hi>Gal.</hi> 32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 5 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13.</note> recordeth to haue hapned the Centurion: and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> auoucheth to the churches of Galatia, Rome, Epheſus: &amp; to his Scholer <hi>Titus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this ſpirit receaued with our iuſtification, is not idle, but worketh ſo in the ſaints, as that he draweth them from ſinne, and pricketh them forward to al good works, that they may be filled with the fruites of righteouſneſſe, which are by Ieſus Chriſt, vnto the glorie, and praiſe of God.</p>
               <p>Herence is it that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth the Saintes, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</note> that they are freed from the law, to ſerue God in the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:19545:140"/> of the Spirite, and not in the oldnes of the letter Whom afterwards he exhorteth to walke, not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit: and thereby to mortifie the luſts of the fleſh, that they might liue. Faith in theſe, is the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13</note> good tree, which bringeth foorth good fruite: in ſome thirtie, in ſome ſixtie, in ſome an hundred fold: without which, the grace of Chriſt is voide; the holy Ghoſt quean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; the Spirite of ſanctification expelled; iuſtification in vaine; profeſſion fruitleſſe; and faith dead, according vnto <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.</note> this doctrine: Euen ſo faith, if it haue no workes, is dead in it ſelfe: which is the application of his ſimilitude, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he prooueth faith without good workes to preuayle nothing.</p>
               <p>After the ſimilitude, and the application thereof, in the next and third place followeth an ironicall and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king preuenting of an obiection: ſet downe of purpoſe by the Apoſtle, againſt thoſe hypocrites, and counterfet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours, which ſo much brag and boaſt of faith: when as they haue no good workes at all in them: they might ſaye to <hi>James;</hi> What ſay you of vs? haue wee no faith? doe not we proteſt that we beleue in God? Is our faith a dead faith alſo?</p>
               <p>Therunto the Apoſtle anſwereth with their iuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe and mockage; Some man may ſay; that is, euerie man may thus conuict thee of hypocriſie, and beat downe thine intollerable pride and inſolency: thou haſt the faith, and I haue workes: Shew me thy faith out of thy workes, and I will ſhewe thee my faith by my workes. Let a man ſay he hath faith, yet hath no workes: he may be iuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued for his hypocriſie: for faith muſt be ſhewed by workes, as the cauſe is ſhewed by his effect: the effectes of faith are workes. Good workes you haue none to auouch the vnfeinednes of your faith: therefore haue you indeede no true faith. For if you haue faith, ſhew it by your works, as I will ſhewe you my faith by my workes. If you cannot ſhewe your faith by your works: then are you hypocrites, bragging of faith when you haue none. Thus therefore, may euery man beate downe your glorious boaſting, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19545:140"/> the pride of your hearts: Thou haſt faith, &amp; I haue works: ſhewe mee thy faith by thy workes, and I will ſhewe thee my faith by my works.</p>
               <p>The force of this place is, that faith is an internall thing, and habite of the minde: impreſſed and imprinted in our hearts by the finger of God, and the power of his ſpirite: and therefore being a qualitie of the minde, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be knowen or made manifeſt, but onely by workes, as the ſignes and effects thereof. For as other gifts and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the minde, as wiſdome, knowledge, and learning: are not perceiued in men but by ſpeach, practiſe, working or other like effects, whereby theſe qualities are expreſſed and vttered foorth: euen ſo, faith (lyeng hidden ſecretely in the minde) is not knowen but by good works, as fruites proceeding from it. And as the goodnes of the tree, whoſe ſappe in winter ſeaſon lieth lowe in the roote, is not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, but when in the Spring time it firſt geueth ſappe to euery branch; then buddeth, blaſſometh, and finally in her due time bringeth foorth fruite: So faith lieth cloaſed in our breaſtes and boſomes, and is not knowen but by bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, bloſſoming, and bringing foorth good workes in vs: the liuely fruites of righteouſneſſe: in ſome thirtie, in others ſixtie, in ſome an hundred folde.

               <p>Our Sauiour would his outwarde actions to bee the witneſſes of his pure affection; wherefore he ſaith to the <note place="margin">

               <p>The promptnes and obedience of <hi>Abrahams</hi> minde, was made apparant by his outward actions: Euery inward habite of the minde, muſt by outwarde ſignes and tokens be made manifeſt.

And Saint <hi>Iames</hi> thus much ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by theſe works: Shew me thy faith by thy workes; and I will ſhewe thee my faith by my works. If therfore we wil make our election ſure and certaine; if we will ſhewe the <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.</note> grace of Chriſt to be in vs effectuall; if we wil make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that wee are ſealed vp with the holy ſeale of Gods ſpirite, to the day of redemption; if we will make it know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, that we are inwardly moued by the holy Ghoſt: Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we will approue our faith for true and liuely faith in Ieſus Chriſt; then muſt we be ſtudious &amp; zealous of good works, that thereby our faith may be ſhewed: leaſt we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre moſt iuſt reprehenſion, and for our hypocriſie bee worthely thus mocked; Shew me thy faith by thy workes, and I will ſhewe thee my faith by thy workes?</p>
               <p>Herence it then appeareth, that good workes are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens and argumentes of mens faith: Whereby it may be knowen, whether they haue true faith in Ieſus Chriſt, or not?</p>
               <p>If workes declare our faith, what ſhall we ſay of the workes of the Infidels, and miſ-beleeuing heathen, whoſe workes were moſt glorious, moſt vvorthie, moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, in the ſight of men? What ſhalbe ſaid of the vvorkes of the proud Phariſies, halting hypocrites, vvhoſe vvorkes are often (to the vievv of men) more vvorthy and more precious, then the vvorks of the very Saints?</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:19545:141"/>
               <p> Shall vve thinke that their vvorks are expreſſe and liuely teſtimonies and arguments of faith? What ſhall vve ſay to the vvorks of men before their iuſtification? Can they ſhevve faith, being before, and vvithout faith?</p>
               <p>To theſe it may be anſvvered; that no vvorkes, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvithout faith, as in Infidels and hypocrites: or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith, as in the Saints before iuſtification, can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted or called good.</p>
               <p>Many things are done of many men, which haue the shevve and outvvard appearance of goodnes: yet procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not from faith, vvhereby they are ſanctified: neither from the ſame cauſes, neither after the ſame manner, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſame end, Whence, hovv, and vvhereunto the vvorkes of the Saints, come, are done, and tende: they are farre from good vvorkes. So that there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betvvixt the vvorks of the Saints and faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God: and the vvorkes of heathenish people &amp; Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers: as betvvixt ſiluer and tinne; golde and copper; vvhich are like; yet not the ſame. The vvorkes of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then come from the lavv and force of nature only; vvhich is corrupt and vitiate: they are attained vnto by vſe, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and exerciſe continuall: their ende is credite, glory, renoume, and eſtimation in the vvorlde. But the vvorkes of Chriſtians proceede from faith, grovve of loue, ſpring out of the knovvledge of the Goſpell, &amp; tend to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of our brethren, and the glorie of God. Theſe mens vvorks shevve foorth and teſtifie their faith, but not the vvorkes of the heathen, Phariſies, or hypocrites, vvhoſe vvorks are not good, neither pleaſe God.</p>

               <p>The workes therefore of the heathen, Phariſies, and hypocrites, are not to be reputed for good: yea all works, which are either before, or without faith, are not good: as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> Apol. 39. 46.

               <p>Wherence then it may be apparant, that all workes ſhewe not, ne argue true faith; neither is it here the mind and meaning of the Apoſtle, to conclude in this manner: Workes ſhew faith: therefore all workes ſhewe faith. Or thus Good workes ſhew and argue faith; therefore euerie one that hath works apparantly good: hath therefore true faith. But his ſcope and drift is, to ſhew that where there is true faith in deede there cannot be but good works will appeare and follow: and that men boaſt of faith in voine, whoſe faith is not accompanied with good works &amp; chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian actions: Seeing that there is no good tree, but in due time bringeth foorth her fruite in conuenient mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Whereof in ſummer time deſtitute, it is accounted naught, dead, fruitleſſes, and rotten.</p>

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11</note> his ſacrifice, putteth <hi>Abell</hi> with his faith firſt, then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his ſacrifice, when he ſaith; God had reſpect to <hi>Abell</hi> and his ſacrifice: to ſhew, that becauſe God accepted <hi>Abels</hi> faith, therefore he reſpected the ſacrifice, proceding from him: and not the man, or his faith, for the ſacrifice. Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> thereof in a certaine place ſpeaketh to the ſame purpoſe; In the iudgement of almightie God there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde <note place="margin">Grego.</note> had, not ſo much what is done or giuen; as of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and how. Herence is it, that God is ſaid to haue looked vnto <hi>Abell</hi> and his gift: For <hi>Moſes</hi> being about to ſay; God looked vnto <hi>Abels</hi> gift; he ſetteth downe carefully before: That God looked vnto <hi>Abell.</hi> By which thing it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſhewed, not that the offerer hath pleaſed, for his gift; but the gift, for the geuer pleaſed God. For this cauſe the gifts of the wicked pleaſe not God, becauſe they come from them with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God is not pleaſed. Thus workes are good in reſpect of mens faith, whereby they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with fauour before God: and are ſuch tokens of our faith, as without which wee boaſt in vaine of faith. Which thing in this place the apoſtle geuing vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, with a mocking quippe, beating downe the vayne pride of hypocrites, ſaith; But ſome man might ſay; eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man might thus mock thee: thou haſt the faith, and I haue works: ſhewe me thy faith by thy workes, and I will ſhewe thee my faith by my works.</p>
               <p>And this is the firſt reaſon why true faith ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be with out works: which reaſon is from a ſimilitude: wherof, and of the other things in that reaſon, The ſimilitude it ſelfe, the application, and the mocking and ironicall preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupating and preuenting of the obiection: This is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to be ſpoken.</p>

                  </note> without good works, is drawen from an abſurditie: if that faith which is without workes, be that true faith wherby we are iuſtified; then the deuils might bee iuſtified: for they haue a bare faith, to beleeue there is a God: albeit
<pb facs="tcp:19545:143"/> they applie not themſelues obediently to walke in his commandements. But it were an abſurd thing to ſay the deuils be iuſtified; for, becauſe they are not iuſtified, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they tremble at the iudgements of God: whereby it appeareth that their faith is not true, nor ſufficient. Now to boaſt of ſuch a faith as is common to deuils, what va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, what follie, what abſurditie is it? This reaſon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in theſe words expreſſeth; Thou beleeueſt there is one GOD, thou doeſt well: the deuils alſo beleeue it, and tremble.</p>
               <p>It were an abſurd thing to ſay the deuils are iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: yet if thy faith be but a bare faith: in worde, without workes; in tongue, without trueth; in ſhewe, without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; they may as well be iuſtified and ſaued as thou by thy like faith maiſt be ſaued: but by ſuch faith which is deſtitute and voide of the workes of true ſanctification, the deuils cannot be iuſtified: therefore neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt thou (O man) be iuſtified by the like. The deuils beleeue, and tremble: yet not iuſtified, not ſaued.</p>
               <p>Now that the deuils beleeue there is one God: yea and confeſſe Ieſus Chriſt to be his onely ſonne, yet trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before his throne, and diuine preſence, the holy word of God, and the moſt ſacred ſcriptures do teach vs: when our bleſſed Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt was come into the land of the Gergeſens, there mette him two m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In another Euangeliſt in like manner, when the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple preaced about Chriſt to be healed: the vncleane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites which were in them whom Chriſt then cured, ſeeing him, fell downe before him, and cried, ſaying; Thou art the ſonne of God.

Whereof the Euangeliſt ſaieth thus: In the Synagogue there was a man which had a ſpirite of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane deuill, which cried with a loude voice, ſaying vnto Ieſus Chriſt, Oh what haue we to doe with thee, Ieſus of Nazareth? Art thou come to deſtroy vs? I know whom thou art, euen the holy one of God.

The deuills then doe not onely beleeue there is one God: but alſo confeſſe Ieſus Chriſt to bee his ſonne, and tremble for feare of his mightie power.</p>
               <p>To conclude, this beliefe of the deuils and vnclean <note place="margin">

Which ſonnes of his, being Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſts, and taking vpon them, to call on the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, whom <hi>Paul</hi> preached: coniured therby the foule and vncleane ſpirites to come out of men: but the euill ſpirit by them thus coniured in a certaine man, anſwered them and ſaid: Ieſus I know, and <hi>Paul</hi> I know: but who are you? Thus did the deuil, nor only beleeue, but confeſſe alſo, not

               <p>Albeit theſe teſtimonies out of the newe Teſtament bee moſt cleare, to teach vs that the deuils beleeue there is one God: yet let vs alſo caſt our eyes vppon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer generations: and looke euen from the beginning: and in the ſucceeding ages, and wee ſhall ſee out of the olde Teſtament alſo this ſame confirmed: and ſo haue a moſt ſweete and pleaſaunt harmonie of them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>VVhen God Almightie had made man, and placed him in the moſt pleaſaunt garden of Eden: and had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <note place="margin">

               <p>VVhen the ſonnes of God, the holie Angels, ſtoode all about the throne of God, and Satan himſelfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the compaſſing of the earth, and the worlde, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.</note> preſented himſelfe alſo before his diuine Maieſtie: and God had demaunded of him, whether he had conſidered <hi>Iob</hi> his ſeruant: The deuill, as beleeuing the heauenlie and diuine nature, confeſſeth the Godheade, in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of <hi>Iob:</hi> hath <hi>Iob</hi> ſerued God for nought? Thus the deuill at that time alſo beleeued.</p>
               <p>Finally, when the Lorde Almightie, ſitting vpon his heauenly throne, and hauing all the hoſte of heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin">3. <hi>Kings</hi> 22.</note> him, as it were conſulting and deuiſing to bring a iuſt plague vpon <hi>Ahab,</hi> the wicked and vngodly King of Iſraell: had but asked the queſtion, who woulde entice <hi>Ahab,</hi> that he might periſh in Ramoth Gilead: Satan the

               <p>Thus then, both the teſtimonies of the olde, and the authorities of the newe Teſtament confirme the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of our Apoſtle: the deuils beleeue and tremble.</p>
               <p>Nowe where the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaieth, thou beleeueſt there is one God, thou doeſt well: the deuils alſo beleeue and tremble: this ſpeach, thou doeſt well: may haue a double ſenſe. For either it may be taken ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronically, and in taunting wiſe: as iuſtly vpbraiding and reprouing them for their vaine oſtentation of fayth, and their boaſting in their beleefe, which is no better then the faith of diuels. VVherefore, as when men doe moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, yet we, in reproouing, in taunting, in mocking and checking manner ſay: O, it is well done: and ſo reproue their iniquitie: So here Saint <hi>Iames:</hi> bitterly and ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inueighing agaynſt the wicked, and iuſtly reproouing their vaine faith, ſayeth; Thou beleeueſt there is one God; thou doeſt well: the deu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ls beleeue alſo, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and ſo condemneth their hypocriſie. As who ſhould ſay: is it well done in deede, when thou doeſt beleeue no better then deuils do?</p>
               <p>Or elſe it may be ſpoken affirmatiuely, and to this ſenſe: thou beleeueſt there is one God: thou doeſt well: for it is a good thing thus to doe: but yet is not this all: neither is it inough or ſufficient, neither muſt thou reſt in that degree of fayth, but goe on, and proceede, and growe from faith to faith: and then to beleeue there is one God, is well. Otherwiſe thy faith ſhall not profite thee: for the deuils alſo beleeue there is one God: yet tremble they in deſperation.</p>
               <p>VVherfore then, if a man ſhoulde deſcribe vnto vs faith in this manner: it is faith, to beleeue there is one God: this definition, declaration, or deſcription of faith were altogether imperfect: neither is this the faith wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:19545:145"/> a man may bee ſaued; for the deuils themſelues haue as good a faith as this: and yet are not ſaued.</p>
               <p>As then it were abſurde for any to ſay, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils ſhall be ſaued: which no man affirmeth, vnleſſe hee be voide of knowledge, bereft of reaſon, enwrapped in errour, doting through follie: ſo it is no leſſe abſurde for men to ſeeke to bee ſaued through that faith, which is common vnto the deuils alſo, yet can not ſaue them: which thing our Apoſtle here teacheth and telleth vs: thou beleeueſt there is one God, thou doeſt well: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils beleeue alſo and tremble.</p>
               <p>To make a plaine, euident and apparant difference, <note place="margin">Credere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. Credere deo. Credere in deum.</note> betwixt true faith and feigned: the faith of the Saints: and the ſhadowe of faith in the wicked, the holy aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and reuerend fathers haue ſhewed, that it is one thing to beleeue that God is, and another thing to beleeue God: and another thing to beleeue in God.</p>
               <p n="1">1 To beleeue that God is, is to beleeue there is a God, and the ſame the creator and the gouernour of heauen and earth: which the verie ſight and view of the creatures, and the frame of the worlde, doth teach all Nations and people, be they neuer ſo rude, neuer ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage, neuer ſo barbarous, as the heathen man, and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the Romaines, <hi>Tullie</hi> in ſundrie of his bookes and <note place="margin">1. <hi>Lib. de na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. deorum.</hi> 1. <hi>Tuſcul.</hi> 1. <hi>de Legib.</hi>

And the verie deuils themſelues: Seeing the wonderfulneſſe of his woorkes: the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie of his power: the incomprehenſibleneſſe of his wiſedome: the terrour and ſeueritie of his iudgements, and the excellencie of his Maieſtie: are alſo forced, will they nill they, to beleeue and perſwade themſelues there is one God. This faith then is common to the heathen and to the Saints: vnto men and vnto deuils: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore therby can we not be ſaued.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To beleeue God, is to beleeue Gods worde to be <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.</note> true: to beleeue that God is faithfull in all his ſayings and holy in all his workes. Which thing, albeit the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſometimes ſeeme to doe: yet ſimplie can they not be
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:19545:145"/> ſaide to beleeue God. For if they either beleeued him to be true in his promiſes, or conſtant in his threatnings: then would they, neither ſo maliciouſly perſecute vertue, neither ſo greedilie follow after vice, as experience doth teach they dayly do.</p>
               <p>If they beleeued God, then either the hope of heauen promiſed in mercie to the righteous: or dreade of damnation threatned in iuſtice to the wicked, woulde withdrawe them from wickedneſſe: but neither the one, neither the other doth perſwade them: therefore do they not rightly beleeue God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 To beleeue in God, is not onely to beleeue that God is, neither only to beleeue all things in his holy word to be moſt certaine and moſt ſure: but alſo particularly to embrace, and ſpecially apply vnto our owne ſelues, all the promiſes made by God the father, in his ſon Ieſus Chriſt, both concerning mercie, and alſo remiſſion of ſinnes, vnto the Saints: to relie, reſt, and ſtay onely vppon his mightie power: to haue all hope of happineſſe in his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fauour: to perſwade our ſelues of true righteouſneſſe, releaſe of ſinne, imputation of iuſtice, eternall ſaluation, onely through his deare ſonne our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt the righteous: who onely died for our ſinnes, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine <note place="margin">

               <p>This faith who ſo hath from God, doeth not onely beleeue God is, neither alone acknowledge him as a moſt mightie Lorde, and moſt iuſt iudge, neither onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelfe generally the things in ſcripture contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be true: which in ſome ſort is common both vnto men &amp; vnto deuils: to the Saints, and to the wicked: but alſo doth loue God, as a father full of all mercy: hope in him for pardon of ſinnes, as in the onely fountaine of
<pb facs="tcp:19545:146"/> grace and goodneſſe: and this faith is chiefly proper vnto the Saints: in whom alſo it bringeth forth the fruites of righteouſnes, that in them God in all things may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified through Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To beleeue therefore that there is one God, is faith more large and generall, then may be accounted ſounde and liuely faith: whoſe proper marke and ſpecifical diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, to applie the ſure promiſes of mercie by God made vnto the Saints; vnto our ſelues: which neyther the wicked of the world, neither the deuils do: therefore by that their faith, can they not be ſaued: yea rather as vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without all hope, through feare of endleſſe damnation, they tremble.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Obiection."/> But a man might ſay, that the faith of Gods elect ſeruaunts is not voide of feare: for to be voide vtterly of feare, is a thing moſt wicked.

               </p>
               <p>But as for the feare and trembling of wicked men and damned ſpirites: it is alwaies through remembrance of Gods iudgementes: and their owne endles torments,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19545:146"/> which in hell they ſhall ſuffer; which are prepared for Satan and his Angels. They feare, becauſe hee alwaies threateneth torments, neuer promiſeth reconcilement: alvvaies appeareth rigorous, neuer fauourable: alvvaies dreadfull, neuer amiable: wherefore they carying daily in their breaſtes and boſomes tormenting furies: which holde them day and night vnder dread of endleſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: when they ſee continually the countenaunce of God againſt them: armed with all the weapons of his vengeaunce to perſequute them: when they ſee they can take no hold-faſt of Gods mercie, for their intollerable pryde, and finall apoſtaſie againſt his heauenly maieſtie: they cannot but feare, they cannot but tremble.</p>
               <p>Now if the Deuils beleeue there is one God: then <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.</note> the Epicures, the Atheiſtes, the wicked fooles of the vvorlde, vvhich ſay in their heartes there is no God: are worſe then deuils.</p>
               <p>If the deuils tremble before Gods preſence, and throne of iudgement: then are many men and women, which ieſt at the day of iudgement, make a mocke at ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing before the tribunall ſeate of God, to receyue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their workes: worſe then deuils.</p>
               <p>If then hypocrites haue no better faith then deuils haue: and it be a moſt abſurde thing to ſay the deuils are ſaued; then is it no leſſe abſurditie to ſay, that wicked men by like faith can be ſaued: ſeeing they are deſtitute of all goodneſſe: voide of all righteouſneſſe: farre from all fruites of ſanctification. Which thing this holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle teacheth vs in this place: thou beleueſt there is one God, thou doeſt well: the deuils alſo belieue, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Finally then, it may herehence appeare neceſſarie; that as men are truly iuſtified before God through faith in Chriſt: ſo they ſhould by their workes, the liuely teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of true faith, ſhewe themſelues before men to be in deede righteous: that as inwardly with God they are made iuſt by their beleefe: ſo outwardly with men, they
<pb facs="tcp:19545:147"/> might be knowen to be iuſte by their deedes: that ſo they might adde to their faith vertue: to their profeſſion, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification: to their religion, holy conuerſation: which is the ſcope and drifte of this Apoſtles doctrine.</p>
               <p>Neither is this doctrine, a doctrine, eyther rarely heard of, or vnuſiall in other places of holy Scripture: for the whole bodie of the Scriptures teach vs, the neceſſitie of good vvorkes and fruits of ſanctification in the ſaints, without which all holineſſe, is hypocriſie: all deuotion, diſſimulation.

                  </note> workes, is drawen from the example of <hi>Abraham:</hi> who had no doubt, a true and liuely faith: for which cauſe hee is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> highly praiſed, both of <hi>Moſes</hi> the Prophet, and <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle of Chriſt: yet did this great and holy Patriarke, by offering vp his ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in whom the hope of his poſteritie, and the truth of Gods promiſe conſiſted, ſhew what manner faith he had: not a dead, barren, and fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe faith; but quick, liuely, and plentifull in all good workes, to the glorie of God. For which cauſe he recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a true teſtimonie from Gods owne mouth, and it was ſet downe by <hi>Moſes,</hi> for all poſteritie for euermore, that he was righteous indeede, and the friend of God. Such a faith ought euery one of Gods Saints to haue therefore, whereby they may recete aueſtimonie from God &amp; man, of their integritie, righteouſnes, and iuſtification.</p>
               <p>The force of this reaſon is this; what maner of faith <hi>Abraham</hi> (the father of the faithfull) had: ſuch faith ought all his children, all the Saintes, all that rightly beleeue in God, and his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, for to haue alſo: But the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> was no ſhadowe nor ſhewe, but a ſubſtance and ſoundnes of faith. His faith was not in worde onely: but in worke alſo: not in tongue and talke
<pb facs="tcp:19545:149"/> alone, but in truth and veritie: not a bare, barren, fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe faith, but a liuely, working and plentifull faith: ſuch faith therefore ought the faith of all Gods Saints to bee, and not deade, without workes. Which thing Saint <hi>Iames</hi> to inſinuate &amp; giue vs to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, he breaketh forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe words, but wilt thou vnderſtande, O thou vaine man, that the faith which is without workes, is deade? was not <hi>Abraham</hi> our father iuſtified through workes, when he offered vp <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſonne vpon the altar?</p>
               <p>Wherein firſt let vs with <hi>Illericus,</hi> ſee the annotation and obſeruation or note of Cardinall <hi>Caiatan,</hi> one of the Romiſh clergy, vpon theſe wordes: wilt thou vnderſtand O thou vaine man, that faith which is without works is <note place="margin">Cardinall Caietane.</note> deade? Marke reader (ſaith he) that <hi>James</hi> meaneth not, that faith without workes is deade, becauſe it is manifeſt that we are iuſtified by faith euen without workes, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by infants baptized, and in olde folke alſo, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and forthwith deceaſing and dying: but he meaneth faith without workes, that is, faith refuſing to worke, is deade, vaine and not able to iuſtifie. Thus euen one of their owne, (who would herence conclude the neceſſitie of workes in the matter of iuſtification,) ſpoke that ſame which we all ſpeake and defende, and for which wee are wrongfully condemned of them, that faith which is not prepared to doe well, when occaſion is offered, but then refuſeth to worke, is deade and profiteth nothing: for as much as true faith worketh alwaies (when matter, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and opportunitie is offered) through loue, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> auoucheth. This ſence of Saint <hi>James,</hi> if the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtes <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.</note> would holde, if not with vs, yet with their owne Cardinall, there ſhould remaine out of this place no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie at all betwixte vs and them, in the matter of iuſtification.</p>
               <p>This foretold, the words of the Apoſtle are plaine, the ſtorie euident, the matter manifeſt, therefore a briefe and pataphraſticall running ouer them may bee ſufficient.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:19545:149"/>
               <p> Wilt thou vnderſtand (ſaith he) ô thou vaine man, that faith without workes is dead? Faith in men iuſtified, deſtitute of workes, or as <hi>Caietane</hi> ſaith; refuſing to doe well when occaſion is offered, is dead indeede: for that all the Saints ſhewe foorth their faith in the practiſe of workes, and vertue.</p>
               <p>The apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> alſo here calleth hypocrites and men vaunting and boaſting of faith, without the fruites of righteouſneſſe, emptie, or vaine: borowing his ſimilitude from barrelles, or other like veſſels: which the emptier they be, the more they doe ſounde and rumble: ſo likewiſe theſe men, the voider they are of true faith, the more they prate and prattle therof: the leſſe ſubſtance they haue of ſound religion: the greater ſhewe and ſound they geue, and therefore may bee well called vaine, or emptie.</p>
               <p>Was not <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father iuſtified, when he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen</hi> 17. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.</note> his ſonne <hi>Iſaac</hi> vpon the Altar? was he not iuſtified through workes? <hi>Moſes</hi> recordeth, that when <hi>Abraham</hi> had obteined a Sonne, according to the promiſe which was made vnto him by God, both when he talked with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and gaue him circumciſion, the ſeale of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and alſo in the day of the deſtruction of Sodom and Gomorrha: he was commaunded to goe to the mount <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.</note> Moriah, and there to offer vp that Sonne, whom GOD had witneſſed ſhould be his heire: and in whom all the nations of the world ſhould be bleſſed. Which thing <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> willingly obeying, cauſeth his Aſſe to be ſadled, wood to be prepared, fire, and a knife to be in a readines: and the next morning, he, and his ſonne, and two of his ſeruantes, tooke their iourney towardes the mount Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah, there to offer vp <hi>Iſaac: Abraham</hi> a farre off ſeeing the place, commaunded his ſeruants to ſtay, laide the wood vpon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> tooke the knife, and fire in his owne handes, and ſo with his Sonne came to the place which the Lord appointed.</p>
               <p>Where hee taketh and bindeth his ſonne, hee ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth out his hande for the knife to haue cut his throate:
<pb facs="tcp:19545:150"/> This his obedience the Lord ſeeing, ſendeth his Angell, ſtayeth <hi>Abraham</hi> from touching the childe, and ſaith vnto him; Now I know that thou feareſt God, in that thou haſt not ſpared thy ſonne, for my ſake. This was the worke of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whereby he made manifeſt, and declared his liuely faith: for which work S. <hi>James</hi> ſaith he was iuſtified, that is, knowen to be iuſt.</p>
               <p>This his faith wrought with his workes, and was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall and fruitfull through his obedience: and through that worke of his obedience, was his faith made perfecte, declared to be ſound, ſhewed to be true, knowen to be liuely and acceptable before God and man. Who the more he by his obedience ſhewed his faith, the more was his faith thereby knowen to be perfect: not that his faith or any mans faith in this world, can be perfect and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> on euery part: For we haue here no gift in the higheſt degree of perfection, which may not daylie be increaſed: and all men muſt learne in humilitie of their Spirites, dailie to praie with the moſt holy Apoſtles; Lord increaſe our faith. But in as much as by good workes our faith <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 17.</note> daily riſeth, and groweth to greater meaſure of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is daily more and more thereby confirmed, and knowen to be perfect: as the more often the tree bringeth foorth fruit, the more plainly is it knowen to be good: it is called perfect.</p>
               <p>That Saint <hi>James</hi> here ſaith of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, that it was made perfect by workes, wee may not therence conclude, that the beginning, and firſt riſing, and ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp of faith is from God, but the conſummation and perfection thereof, from our ſelues, and our own works: For what were this, but intollerable pride, in aſcribing the leſſe to God, the greater to our ſelues: the beginning of good to him, the conſummation and accompliſhment to our ſelues: to chalenge and arrogate praiſe vnto our workes, and to derogate from his glorie? where againſt the Princely Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth, when he ſaith; Not <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.</note> vnto vs, ô Lord, nor vnto vs, but vnto thy name geue the praiſe.</p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:19545:150"/>
               <p> For were the beginnings from God, but the perfection in our works; then looke how much more excellent the perfection and ende of euery thing is, then the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and the conſummation of faith, then the entrance or inchoation thereof: ſo much more praiſe ſhoulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to vs, then to God himſelfe: Which thing to deſire, were great vngodlines: to attempt, were horrible pride: boldly to chalenge, were not onely ſhamefull preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the full meaſure of all iniquitie.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let vs learne a better profeſſion, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe all in all vnto God, who both beginneth, and alſo maketh perfect whatſoeuer is perfect in vs: hee it is that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Philip.</hi> 2</note> worketh in vs, both to will, and alſo to perfourme, according to his good pleaſure. From whom we haue all <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3</note> our ſufficiencie, who of our ſelues, as of our ſelues, are not able to thinke a good thought, much leſſe to make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte any thing in our ſelues: but all our ſufficiencie is from God, from whom euery good, and euerie perfecte <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iames</hi> 1.</note> gift proceedeth, as from the father of lights. So that not onely the beginning of faith, but the increaſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection therof, is from him.</p>
               <p>For which cauſe as the Apoſtles prayed to Chriſt, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 17</note> (who is God, bleſſed for euer) for increaſe of ſaith; ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> aſcribing the perfection, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and conſummation of all things vnto GOD, haue therefore praied vnto God, as plainly appeareth in their Epiſtles; The God of peace, that brought againe from <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.</note> the dead our Lord Ieſus, the great Shepheard of the ſheepe, through the bloud of the euerlaſting couenant, make you perfecte in all good workes, to doe his will, woorking in you that which is pleaſaunt in his ſight, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe Ieſus Chriſt, to whom be praiſe for euer and euer, Amen.</p>
               <p>And Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> And the God of all grace, which <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.</note> hath called vs vnto his eternal glorie by Chriſt Ieſus, after that ye haue ſuffered a little, make you perfect, confirme ſtrengthen, and ſtabliſh you: to whom be glorie for euer and euer.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19545:151"/>
               <p> Thus then the beginning, continuance, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe: yea the perfection and eſtabliſhment of the very faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was onely from God, as the cauſe: yet is it knowen to be perfect, and declared ſo to be, before men, through workes, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth: and the Scripture was fulfilled, when by his obedience it did clearely appeare, how truely it was written of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued, and it was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 15</note> imputed vnto him for righteouſnes. So that his worke is ſaid in the Scripture, to haue made the teſtimonie of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> true, cleare, and euident, that <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued, and that his faith to that word of promiſe, (that one of his owne loines and bowels ſhould be his heire) was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him for righteouſnes.</p>
               <p>This being the argument of Saint <hi>James,</hi> from the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that what faith was in him, the like ought to be in all Gods Saints: and that as his faith was ioyned with the worke of obedience to God, when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was miniſtred: ſo ought the faith of euerie one of the children of God, to be bewtified, accompanied, &amp; ſhewed foorth through good works: The concluſion is inferred; You ſee then how that a man is iuſtified of workes, that is, <note place="margin">The concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made.</note> proued, and knowen to men, to be iuſt and righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God by workes, and not by faith onely: not of a colde, dead, bare, barren, fruitleſſe, idle faith onely: ſuch a faith as is in words, when we ſay we haue faith, though we haue no workes: Of which faith hypocrites ſo much glorie, and make boaſtein vaine, as of that faith which is no true faith.</p>
               <p>And this concluſion muſt agree in the ſame ſence of tearmes, wherein the example was propoſed: and the tearmes herein to be noted, are ſpecially two: Iuſtified, and faith. Iuſtified, in the example propoſed, ſignifieth to be knowen for iuſt: not to be made iuſt. Faith ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that bare profeſſion, whereby in words we ſay we haue faith, and the religion of Chriſt. Such faith was not in <hi>Abraham,</hi> therefore neither is any other man by ſuch a faith reputed for righteous.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:19545:151"/>
               <p> And their wordes thus in the ſame and right ſenſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the concluſion is true: a man is not iuſtified by faith onely, but by workes: faith onely in wordes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not men to bee knowen for righteous among men: but faith in workes and deedes.</p>
               <p>Theſe things thus ſet downe in the example of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </note> the fourth and laſt argument, which faith in gods Saints is not without workes: is drawne from <hi>Rahab</hi> the vittailer, tauerner, hoſteſſe, or harlot of Ierico: whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample teacheth the ſame that <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> did: that the faith of Gods Saints is not fruitleſſe, or void of good works: for ſhe alſo was iuſtified through workes, when ſhe receyued the meſſengers: and ſent them out another way. The ſtorie is recorded in the booke of <hi>Ioſua:</hi> wherein it is ſet downe, that at what time as <hi>Ioſua,</hi> by the counſell and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioſua</hi> 2.</note> commaundement of God, purpoſed the ſiege and ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Ierico the Citie: he ſent before him two men, to ſpie out, and to view the land, and the Citie: which thing comming to the eares of the King of Ierico, that there were ſuch men come to the houſe of <hi>Rahab:</hi> hee ſent to her to ſend him the men: ſhe ſeeing that, being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they were the true ſeruants of the God of heauen &amp; earth, and that the lande ſhould bee giuen by God into their hands (wherin her faith conſiſted:) ſhe hid the men: and tolde the meſſengers of the King, that they were gone, and ſo ſent them away: who being gone, ſhee came to the ſpies, and tolde them how their feare was vpon the inhabitants of the land: therefore deſired ſhe them, that as ſhe had ſhewed them mercie, ſo they would ſhewe he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> mercie, when the Citie ſhould be deſtroyed. This was promiſed: a ſigne and warning was giuen, ſhee ſendeth them away: and ſo they eſcaped. This her facte Saint <hi>Iames</hi> commendeth, affirming that thereby ſhee alſo was iuſtified: euen knowen for righteous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared thereby to the ſpyes of <hi>Ioſua,</hi> and to all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</p>
               <p>The force of this place then is this: as <hi>Abraham,</hi> through bare and naked faith deſerued not the prayſe
<pb facs="tcp:19545:152"/> of iuſtice, righteouſneſſe, and iuſtification before men: ſo neither did <hi>Rahab:</hi> but as <hi>Abraham</hi> hauing occaſion thereto, ſhewed his fayth by his holy obedience: ſo <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> ſhewed the vnfeignedneſſe of her fayth, by her ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and ſending away ſafely the meſſengers of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſua:</hi> and ſo both of them were iuſtified before men, and in the vewe of the worlde: not by faith onely, that is bare faith: but by workes whereby their faith was ſhewed and made manifeſt.</p>
               <p>In theſe two examples, all men are contained, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iewe or Gentile, whether righteous or prophane and openly wicked. <hi>Abrahams</hi> example containeth all Iewes, and all men of vertue and godlineſſe. <hi>Rahabs</hi> example containeth all Gentiles, ſtraungers from Gods people, all wicked perſons, which yet through the grace of GOD are planted in the Church, and made mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the bodie of Chriſt: wherein the diuerſitie of the argument conſiſteth.</p>
               <p>Thus the holie Apoſtle culled and picked out two moſt diuerſe and vnlike examples, the one of a man, the other of a woman: the one of Gods people, the other of a ſtraunger: the one of one godly, the other of one wicked: to the ende that thereby he might teach men, that none, neither man nor woman, neither Iewe nor Gentile: neither of the people of GOD, nor ſtraunger: neither godly, nor wicked: can bee repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or reckened for iuſt and righteous before GOD in deede: whoſe praiſe appeareth not in the practiſe of vertue and good workes, by which they are ſhewed and knowen for righteous before men. So that in none, vvhat kinde or condition: what people or nation, what coaſt or countrie ſo euer they bee of, true faith can bee void and deſtitute of vvorks: as by theſe arguments novv appeareth moſt manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Novve the Apoſtle againe repeateth the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: <note place="margin">The concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repeated.</note> that as the bodie voyde of the ſoule and ſpirite, is deade: ſo fayth vvithout vvoorkes is deade alſo. That vvhen the ſoule is out of the bodie, the bodie
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19545:152"/> is voyde of office, of action, and all things which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue life: So fayth deſtitute of good workes, ſheweth no duetie of loue: giueth no teſtimonie of life: hath no ſigne or force and efficacie: profiteth not: is like a deade carkaſſe: is but an idoll or ſhadowe of fayth. And this is the concluſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe things thus ſetdowne: howbeeit it maie plainely appeare, what the drifte and ſcope of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> was: onelie to beate downe the pride of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who bragged and boaſted of faith without the fruites of iuſtification and righteouſneſſe: and not to oppoſe himſelfe agaynſt Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who in ſo manie places prooueth that wee are iuſtifyed by fayth without the woorkes of the lawe: and thereunto alledgeth the ſame <hi>Abraham</hi> for example of iuſtification by fayth, whome the Apoſtle vſeth for iuſtification by workes: as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.</note> our aduerſaries oppoſe them, and ſet the one agaynſt the other: as if the ſpirite of GOD in them were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided: yet that all doubting and halting betwixt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe opinions may bee remooued: all controuerſie which in appearaunce ſeemeth great betwixt theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, may bee taken away: that the controuerſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs and our aduerſaries may the better bee appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and all occaſion of abuſing this place for their iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by works before GOD, ſecluded: there are foure things diligently to bee examined and diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, wherein the whole matter conſiſteth. 1 What fayth Saint <hi>James</hi> meaneth, when in this place hee ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyeth againſt it. 2 In what ſenſe iuſtification is to bee taken in this controuerſie. 3 VVhat woorkes hee meaneth, woorkes before or after fayth, when he aſcribeth iuſtification to woorkes. 4 What manner of men and people he dealt withall, and to what perſons he ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Touching faith: all men almoſt boaſt thereof, <note place="margin">Faith is diuerſe.</note> all men glorie therein: yet the hundred thouſand perſon ſcarſely knoweth aright, what true, ſound, and iuſtifying,

               <p>The acceptions and ſignifications of faith, vſuall and common, are chiefly fiue. 1 Is ciuill faith, conſiſting in vpright dealing, and keeping touch, worde and promiſe with men. Of which the Philoſophers ſpeake much: and <hi>M. Cicero</hi> giuing the deriuation of the name and worde, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Off.</hi>
                  </note> ſaith: that faith is ſo called, becauſe that is done, which is ſayde. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſeeing faithfulneſſe to <note place="margin">

This faith, is the truth and conſtancie which ought to bee in our deedes, and wordes, and the keeping of promiſe in matters of this life: and is therefore called ciuil faith, as being conuerſant in ciuill things.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There is alſo faith, which is hyſtoricall: which is the knowledge and confeſſion of the things to bee true, which wee reade in the olde or newe Teſtament. Thus in generall wee call the knowledge of theſe things faith. The knowledge of the Articles of our beliefe, is called Chriſtian fayth. The knowledge of things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, is called faith. The knowledge of the ſtorie, which <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.</note> the diuels themſelues had, is called faith: the diuels beleeue: they beleeue the ſtorie of the creation of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iames</hi> 2.</note> worlde, and other things therein contained: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the ſtorie of Chriſtes life, death, paſſion, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, miracles, to bee true: yet are not ſaued. This faith is hiſtoricall, becauſe it beleeueth onely the ſtorie
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19545:153"/> written: as they that beleeue the Chronicles of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, Fraunce, Irelande, Italie, Germanie: that ſuch Cities, Townes, Riuers, Mountaines, are therein: haue faith, and are ſayde to giue faith thereunto. To beleeue that Carthage was deſtroyed by the Romanes: Numantia, by <hi>Scipio:</hi> Hieruſalem by <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian:</hi> the Kingdome of Iſrael to haue ended, when <hi>Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manaſer</hi> the King of Aſſiria ouercame them: the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <note place="margin">4. <hi>King.</hi> 7.</note> of Iudah and Hieruſalem, by <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> of Babel, who caried them into captiuitie into Babylon: that the Babylonians were ſubdued by the Medes and <note place="margin">4. <hi>King.</hi> 25.</note> Perſians: that GOD made the worlde: that Chriſt was borne of a Virgine: that hee was conuerſant vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth thirtie yeares or thereaboutes: that hee was put to death by the malice of the Iewes, through the treaſon of <hi>Judas:</hi> that hee roſe againe, and aftet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde aſcended: and ſo therein to go no further: is an hiſtoricall fayth, which is common to men and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels; to Turks and Chriſtians; the godleſſe and godly; the righteous and the wicked.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Sometimes fayth is taken for the power which is giuen men, whereby they are able to worke and doe great miracles. That fayth which there about is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant, is called a fayth myraculous: as occupied in <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 25.</note> doing miracles. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſo vſeth it, when he ſaith, to one is giuen the worde of wiſedome by the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite; to an other the worde of knowledge by the ſame ſpirite; to another is giuen faith by the ſame ſpirit. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Theophilact</hi> ſaith, not faith of doctrine, but faith of <note place="margin">Theophilact.</note> ſignes, which when they are wrought haue power to moue mountaines.</p>
               <p>In which ſenſe in the next Chapter <hi>Paul</hi> is to bee <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> vnderſtoode, where, intreating of the faith which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in working of miracles, ſaieth; If I had faith, ſo that I coulde mooue mountaines out of their places, and haue no loue: I were nothing. Which kinde of faith Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> affirmeth may bee euen in them <note place="margin">Ambroſe.</note> which are wicked, and not of good conuerſation. Which
<pb facs="tcp:19545:154"/> our Sauiour putteth out of doubt, when to manie <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.</note> which prophecied and wrought miracles in his name. hee ſayde: Away from mee ye workers of iniquitie, I knowe you not. This fayth was euen in the traitour <hi>Iudas,</hi> who with the reſt wrought miracles, and did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders among the children of men. This faith alſo, if it <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 10,</note> ſtay in working of miracles, profiteth nothing to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Moreouer, faith is applied to the outwarde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of men, when in wordes and ſhewe they ſeeme to beleeue in Chriſt, yet are careleſſe of the fruites of ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and righteouſneſſe: whereby faith is knowen vnto the world. This is the faith of hypocrites: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called hypocriticall. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> calleth it deade, fruitleſſe, barren. This faith beareth great ſway and ſwinge in the worlde: ruleth and reigneth in the moſt part of men, and in the common multitude of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours: whereof the number is infinit, which profeſſe great faith, great holineſſe, great religion; yet are careleſſe to walke woorthie their profeſſion: and indeuour not to bee fruitefull in the woorkes of righteouſneſſe, to the glorie of GOD: therefore is their faith vaine, idle, deteſtable and ſhamefull in the ſight of GOD.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The laſt kinde of fayth is Chriſtian faith: which is a ſure truſt in the mercie of GOD, through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt: vndoubtinglie perſwading our ſelues of remiſſion of our ſinnes, by his righteouſneſſe: and of eternall ſaluauion by his paſſion: whereby hauing peace in our conſciences with GOD, wee reſt and walke in obedience vnto his commaundements. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Prophet ſpeaketh: The iuſt ſhall liue by fayth. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Abac.</hi> 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</note> Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Wee conclude, that a man is iuſtified by fayth without the woorkes of the lawe.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:19545:154"/> by Chriſt wee haue boldneſſe and entraunce with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.</note> by faith in him. Of this faith <hi>Paul</hi> alwayes ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, when hee entreateth of iuſtification: which wee obtayne onelie by this faith in Ieſus Chriſt. And <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.</note> this is the fayth whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> vvas iuſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD: when it was auouched: <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, and it was imputed vnto him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>And this faith is neuer idle in the Saintes of GOD, hauing iuſt occaſion miniſtred: but it woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth through loue, and hath moſte ſingular orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.</note> and vertues ioyned vnto it, as inſeparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in all thoſe that are truelie iuſtified: as inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of GOD: gratefull memorie for benefites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued: pacience and inuincible conſtancie vnder the Croſſe: bounteous liberalitie, and louing mercie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the diſtreſſed Saints in their neceſſities: obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the worde of truth, mortification of our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly members: renouation of the ſpirite of our mindes, with the woorkes of ſanctification, which as effectes of fayth, make it ſhine and bee manifeſt in the ſight of men.</p>
               <p>There then being many acceptions of faith: whereof ſpeaketh this Apoſtle? not of the laſt as <hi>Paul</hi> doth: but of the ſecond, and of the fourth. That he ſpeaketh of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, it appeareth: in the 19. verſe, hee ſpeaketh of that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 19.</note> faith which is common to men and to diuels: for hee ſayeth: thou beleeueſt there is one God, thou doſt well: the diuels alſo beleeue and tremble. Now the diuels haue no true nor iuſtifying faith: that were abſurd to graunt: for they beleeue not in Chriſt, neither hope they for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: but tremble in deſpaire at the iudgement of God: but their faith is, to beleeue there is one God: to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the things contained in the ſcripture of the old and new teſtament to be true: to confeſſe Chriſt to be the ſon of god: but neither Meſſiah nor mediator for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That he meaneth faith in the 4. ſenſe, which is the outward preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of faith: which is rather a ſhew &amp; ſhadow, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb facs="tcp:19545:155"/> rather an imagination and conceyued opinion of faith, then faith in deed: as when we ſay we haue fayth, and in wordes pretende it. It appeareth alſo out of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. For Saint <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh of that faith, when men <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 14. <hi>Verſe</hi> 19.</note> ſay they haue fayth: as himſelfe in the propoſition of this place ſpeaketh. What auaileth it my brethren though a man (ſaith he) ſay he hath faith, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath no worke? Can his faith ſaue him? The Apoſtle inueieth againſt a bare pretence of faith: againſt that faith vvhich is in vvordes onely, vvhich is a verball faith. As alſo Saint <hi>Thomas of Aquine</hi> their angelicall Doctour confeſſeth: <note place="margin">S. Thomas.</note> vvho expounding the ſimilitude, in the fifteenth and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenth verſes expreſſed: follovving the ſame ſenſe of faith, ſaieth: As liberalitie in vvordes helpeth not the poore, vnleſſe meat and other neceſſarie things be giuen &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred: ſo neither that faith vvhich is in vvords, can ſaue vs. Thus hee expoundeth Saint <hi>Iames</hi> of verball faith, vvhich in vvordes onely conſiſteth. Seeing then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of a true, liuely, and fruitfull faith, vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by vve liue: &amp; <hi>Iames</hi> of a dead, rotten, barren faith, vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are counted dead: they ſpeake of faith in diuerſe ſignifications: and therefore are not contrarie, neither to bee oppoſed: neither can one and the ſame effect of iuſtification before GOD, bee applyed vnto both theſe kindes: yea the faith vvhereof <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, iuſtifieth before God, and the faith vvhereof <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh dooth not: therefore ſpeake they not of one kinde of fayth. For vvhich cauſe the concluſion of Saint <hi>James</hi> cannot be ment of the faith mencioned in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> but of another: vvhen hee ſaieth, ye ſee then that a man is iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified through vvorkes, and not of faith onely.</p>
               <p>This faith then is the faith of diuels and hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, not the faith of Chriſtians. And ſo the place ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth nothing at all againſt the doctrine, vvhich vvee out of <hi>Paul</hi> preach, that vve are iuſtified by faith onely, by a liuely faith onely. But not by a bare, dead or fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe faith onely: vvhich vvith Saint <hi>Iames</hi> vvee alſo preach vnto the worlde. Thus the aduerſaries of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vpon</hi> 2. <hi>chap. ver.</hi> 15. 16.</note>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:19545:155"/> the goſpell play in the word faith, and make a doubtfull argument out of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> from the manifold ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith: when they conclude, that faith onely doeth not iuſtifie vs.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Now as faith is manifolde, ſo iuſtification, or to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Double iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Pſal.</hi> 32. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> iuſtifie, is double. There is iuſtifying before God, which is, to be reputed as righteous: to haue our ſinnes forgeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and our iniquities pardoned in the ſight of God: which is the righteouſneſſe and iuſtification mentioned of the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet, and remembred of <hi>Paul:</hi> Bleſſed is that man whoſe vnrighteouſnes is forgeuen, and whoſe ſinnes are coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: bleſſed is that man vnto whom the Lorde imputeth not ſinne.</p>
               <p>This iuſtification is by faith, as <hi>Moſes</hi> confeſſeth in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> by his example proueth in the reſt of the Saints: <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued God, and it was counted vnto him for righteouſneſſe. Of this iuſtification <hi>Paul</hi> to the Romanes, Galathians, Epheſians, Philippians, and in all other places ſpeaketh: whenſoeuer he affirmeth, that wee are iuſtified by faith: by which, men, onely are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God.</p>
               <p>As there is iuſtifying before God which is through ſaith: So is there iuſtification before men: which is to be ſhewed, declared, and knowen of men, to be iuſt and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. And this iuſtifying is by works, which onely ſhewe foorth our faith to the knowledge of men: and make it knowen to the worlde, that we are righteous and iuſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede. Thus by his obedience (as, the fruites of his faith) was <hi>Abraham</hi> iuſtified in offering his ſonne: the offering whereof made him not righteous before God, but his faith: but it made him knowen to men, to haue beene iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified before God through faith: and ſo hee was iuſtified before men through works. Thus to be iuſtified by works with men, is to be ſhewed and knowen for righteous: or as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith; To bring to paſſe that one be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of the ſpirite letter. c.</hi> 26.</note> and reputed for iuſt and righteous: as in the Goſpell, the Phariſie falſly perſwading himſelfe of righteouſneſſe, ſought to haue iuſtified himſelfe: that is, brought to paſſe, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 18.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19545:156"/> that he might haue beene reputed for iuſt, by faſting, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of tithes, geuing of almes, and ſuch like works which he did. Thus the Scribes and Phariſies by their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded workes, and ſhewe of godlines, by the outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and actions which they did in the knowledge and ſight of men: thereby before men ſought to bee reputed, eſtemed, and reckoned for righteous: Which being done <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 16.</note> in ſingular and notable hypocriſie: our Sauiour worthelie and ſharply inueyeth againſt them: Ye are they which iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie your ſelues before men. (How? by their workes, and outward life.) But God knoweth your heartes: for that which is highly eſteemed among men, is abhominable in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>Seeing there is a double iuſtifying: one before God, through faith alone; the other before men, onely through workes: of which kinde ſpeaketh Saint <hi>James?</hi> he ſpeaketh of being iuſtified before men, not before God: which thing ſhall appeare euidently.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Out of the ſtorie it ſelfe: wherin it is recorded, that <note place="margin">

               <p>Thus he alſo affirmeth, that <hi>Iames</hi> ſpoke of workes <note place="margin">

S. <hi>Paul</hi> (as appeareth in many places of the new Teſtament) had to do with ſuch as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded men, that vnleſſe they obſerued the lawe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they could not be ſaued: whom he confuteth, out of the law it ſelfe, out of the Prophets, <hi>Dauid, Abacuk,</hi> &amp; others: out of the Goſpell, and true ende and vſe, both of it, and of the lawe of <hi>Moſes:</hi> to which purpoſe hee ſetteth downe a doctrine quite contrarie thereunto: that men are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith in Ieſus Chriſt, without the works of the lavv of <hi>Moſes.</hi> To the eſtabliſhing of which aſſertion, affirma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and opinion, the Epiſtle to the Romanes, Galathians, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians, and Philippians, ſeemeth to haue beene penned and written. In proceſſe of time, this aſſured doctrine was wroong and wreſted by ſome: gathering that it was not needefull for ſuch as by faith in Ieſus Chriſt were iuſtified: to be followers of good workes: but that to beleeue onlie barelie, without care of holy conuerſation, was ſufficient.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19545:157"/> Which to preuent, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> in thoſe forenamed Epiſtles oftentimes ioyneth exhortations to manners: ſo S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſeeing the carnall profeſſors greatly to abuſe the goſpell, to the libertie and looſenes of the fleſh: in this Epiſtle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countreth with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> teſtifying and proteſting to all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that faith in men pretending iuſtification, without works: is but as a dead carkas. And thus hee writeth not againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> but with him, againſt ſuch as peruerted his doctrine, and abuſed their libertie and free iuſtification, to the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe of the fleſh, as men now do alſo: who hearing iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by faith onely, thinke themſelues thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and ſet at libertie from the practiſe of holines: which is their errour, in that they conceiue not, that as we are freely iuſtified before God through faith, without the helpe or reſpect of our works: ſo are we knowen to be iuſt by workes before men: whereby God for his mercie is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified: and therefore ought to be perfourmed of vs.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Paul</hi> diſputeth againſt thoſe which attributed too much to works, as helping cauſes of ſaluation. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> reaſoneth againſt ſuch, as making too vile account of workes, vtterly neglected them. S. <hi>Paul</hi> had to doe with phariſaical hypocrites, who ſwelled with the pride of their owne workes and righteouſnes: S. <hi>Iames</hi> with Epicuricall profeſſours, who boaſting themſelues of their hiſtoricall and bare faith and profeſſion: refuſe to bring foorth the fruites of righteouſneſſe. Seeing then theſe two ſpeake of diuers kindes of faith; ſeeing they ſpeake in diuers ſence of iuſtification; ſeeing they ſpeake of works diuerſly: and contend finally againſt diuers perſons; ſeeing <hi>Paul</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſheth true, Chriſtian, liuely faith: S. <hi>James</hi> condemneth bare, fruiteleſſe, idle faith: Seeing <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification with God: <hi>Iames</hi> how we are knowen for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before men: Seeing <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of works before faith, denying them for cauſes of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: <hi>Iames</hi> of works following faith, allowing them for effects and fruites ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Seeing <hi>Paul</hi> denieth good works to goe before men, to be iuſtified: S. <hi>Iames</hi> confeſſeth them to follow men being iuſtified: Seeing <hi>Paul</hi> conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth againſt ſuch as too much
<pb facs="tcp:19545:158"/> preferred works: S. <hi>James</hi> againſt thoſe which too much neglected them: therefore no controuerſie, but a perfect conſent and harmonie in their doctrine. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth more cleare (I hope) then the Sunne at noon day, how ſhameleſly our aduerſaries abuſe this place, againſt free iuſtification by faith: for the eſtabliſhing of workes, as cauſes of ſaluation and iuſtification with God.</p>
               <p>And thus much of faith and works; the cauſe and the effects, neceſſarilie ioyned together in all thoſe that are iuſtified in Ieſus Chriſt: To whom, with the Father and the holy Ghoſt, three perſons in Trinitie, one eternal and euerliuing God in Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, be rendered all praiſe, domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and maieſtie: now and for euer.

The firſt is, Let no man v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe authoritie ambiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to iudge and cenſure his brother in ſharpeneſſe and rigour of iudgement: in the firſt, and part of the ſecond verſe contayned. In which there are two things to bee noted. 1 The exhortation it ſelfe: My brethren, bee not manie maiſters. 2 The reaſons of the exhortation: firſt from the iudgement of GOD, ſecondly, from our owne imbecilitie and weakeneſſe. who our ſelues in manie things offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, we ought not to be too ſeuere and rigorous againſt others.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:19545:159"/>
               <p> The ſeconde place of this Chapter, is concerning the gouernement and refrayning of the tongue: begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the latter part of the ſeconde verſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to the thirteenth verſe hereof. In which part there are two things. 1 The propoſition it ſelfe. 2 part, 2. verſe. If anie man ſinne not in his tongue, or in worde, he is a perfect man, and able to bridle the whole bodie. 2 The tractation and handling of the matter concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the tongue, which is double: firſt from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of moderating the tongue: which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> expreſſeth by two ſimilitudes: the one of horſes, who are gouerned by the bitte and cheeke of the bridle. 3. v. Then by the ſimilitude of a Shippe, which is guided by the ſterne or rudder. 4. 5. v. Then he handleth the matter of moderating the tongue, from the euils of the tongue: which hee ſetteth downe, firſt generally: in the ſeconde part of the fourth verſe, and in the firſt part of the ſixt: then particularly: from the ſeconde part of the ſixt verſe, to the thirteenth verſe, wherein he noteth three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar euils of the tongue, 1 That it defileth the whole bodie. 2 That it is a thing vntameable, and vnbrideled. 3 That it is reprochful, contumelious, and giuen to curſed bittereeſſe.</p>
               <p>The thirde part and place is, from the thirteenth verſe to the ende: concerning gentleneſſe and meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of wiſedome. In which diſcourſe foure things are touched. 1 An exhortation to meekeneſſe, verſe 13. 2 The oppoſition of the contrarie, which is contention. condemned and ſpoken againſt by the Apoſtle. verſe 14. 3 The diſtinguiſhing of wiſedome, which is either earthly, or heauenly: by the which the way to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde miſchiefes is precluded and ſhutte vp, 15. 16. and 17. verſes. 4 The laſt is a reaſon drawne from rewarde, why the Saints of GOD ſhoulde embrace and followe meekeneſſe of wiſedome, verſe 18.

Theſe wordes in the firſt, and part of the ſecond verſe of this third Chapter, concerne the firſt part and place, which is of not vſurping ambicious authoritie to iudge and cenſure the brethren ſharpely, and rigorouſly: and why wee ſhould not ſo doe, as ſhall appeare.</p>

               <p>Such haue all times and ages brought forth: and our time is not voide thereof.

A preſumptuous, proud and ſuperſtitious ſort of men, whom nothing pleaſeth, which themſelues doe not: and by whom all are condemned, which daunce not after their pipe: which walke not after their rules: which liue not after the order of their liues.

Thus condemneth the Apoſtle, that cenſure-like arrogancie of the proude, chalenging authoritie to themſelues to iudge others as they luſt: and forbiddeth, that euerie one ſhould thinke himſelfe a fit reformer and cenſurer of the life of his brethren: My bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, be not many maiſters.</p>

               <p>In thought, our falles are ſo many, as that it paſſeth the ſtrength of man, by cogitation not to admit the thing which is either wicked in deed, or euil to vtter. In ſo much as righteous and holy men, who abſtaine in many thinges from wicked actions: yet oftentimes (through infirmity of nature, are caried by cogitations, to euil thoughts: ſo that there is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnleſſe he be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated (as it were) into the nature of God, who ſinneth not in cogitation. So that the Apoſtle, in reſpect of theſe, hath here truely auouched, in many thinges we fall all. Which thing men conſidering, ſhall the better refraine their ſeueritie of iudgement, and rigor in cenſuring their chriſtian brethren.</p>
               <p>Three reſpects there are in men, wherby their rigor towards others ſhould be abated. 1 To recount what in former times themſelues haue beene. 2 To thinke what hereafter they may be. 3 To remember what preſently they are.</p>
               <p n="1">1 If we conſider what our ſelues haue beene in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, it ſhall mittigate greatly the ſeueritie of our iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and rigorous cenſuring of our brethren. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorting men to patience, and gentlenes towardes other, and not to be ſeuere againſt their offending &amp; weak brethren, thus reaſoneth; They now are what you in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.</note> times haue beene: call therefore to minde your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer condition, and be patient; ſhewe all meeknes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to all men. For we our ſelues were in times paſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, diſobedient, deceiued: ſeruing luſtes and diuers plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: liuing in maliciouſnes and enuie, hatefull, &amp; hating one another.</p>
               <p>The recounting therefore of our former condition, muſt aſſwage the ſeueritie of our iudgement, and make vs more moderate toward ſuch, as now are what we haue beene. Wee our ſelues once were ignorant; wee once went out of the way; wee ſometimes haue beene ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with naturall infirmitie: whereby we haue committed
<pb facs="tcp:19545:164"/> things not conuenient. Let vs not ſeuerely iudge, and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly condemne ſuch as are ſubiect to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and frailties of nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As to record our former ſtate, ſhall abate our ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: ſo to thinke with our ſelues whereunto wee may fall: being compaſſed about alwaies with theſe infirmities. S. <hi>Paul</hi> (to perſwade men to ſhew meeknes, &amp; not ſharpenes <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.</note> of iudgement towards ſuch as fall through occaſion) rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth from the frailtie of our ſtate, whereby we are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to like falling: to which purpoſe he thus ſpeaketh to the Saints of Galatia; Brethren, if a man be ſodenly taken in any offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: ye which are ſpirituall, reſtore ſuch a one in the ſpirite of meekenes: conſidering thy ſelfe, leaſt thou alſo be tempted. Wherein he wiſely condemneth imor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate rigour; and worthelie reproueth thoſe, which are commonly moſt ſeuere iudges againſt their brethren; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they altogether forget their owne infirmitie, wherby they may fall into like offences.</p>
               <p>Now there is no infirmitie; no iniquitie among men; finall impenitencie, and the ſinne vnto death, or againſt the holy Ghoſt, excepted: whereinto, euen the beſt men, may not fall. Which if they conſider, it will eaſilie mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their rigour and ſeueritie againſt their brethren, and make them take heede, leaſt ambitiouſly they vſurpe this authoritie againſt others.</p>
               <p>And how true it is, that euen the beſt may fall, eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent examples, and wofull experience may teach vs. Who knoweth not, that lyeng is a ſinne againſt the ninth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, condemned by God and his Prophets: yet holy and faithfull <hi>Abraham;</hi> godly <hi>Iſaac,</hi> fell thereinto, as <note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.</note> crieth out; that in his conuerſion Chriſt ſhewed all cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie. Secondly by the falles of great perſons, both themſelues haue cauſe to humble themſelues before god, and not waxe proud of any thing: and others ſeeing the moſt excellent men ſubiect to infirmitie, are therence to be admoniſhed of their greater infirmities: for if the great oakes of Baſan, and the mightie and tall Cedars of Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non fall: what is to be looked for of the lowe trees of the forreſt? if the righteous bee hardly ſaued: what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the wicked? <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, all men may thereby gather the frailtie of their nature: and ſo pray to God, when they ſtande, that <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> they fall not.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing all men are ſubiect to this condition, that they may fall, if they be not vpholden and ſupported by the helpe of God: it ought to qualifie our haſty iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to moderate the ſeueritie of the ſame againſt the brethren.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Finally, we ſhalbe more temperate towards other men: if we conſider whereunto wee are preſently ſubiect: which is the reaſon here vrged. The conſcience of our owne ſinnes, and the diligent view of our owne weaknes and wickednes; maketh vs more gentle towardes others: which men then forget, when they are too ſeuere iudges
<pb facs="tcp:19545:165"/> of their brethren. To this purpoſe <hi>Siracides</hi> exhorteth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 8.</note> not to deſpiſe ſuch, as hauing ſinned, turne therefro: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to caſt it in their teeth; but rather to remember, that we are all worthy of blame. When we conſider our owne ſelues, we ſhall ſee there is in vs many things to be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. This diligent conſideration will make vs more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of not rigorouſly and raſhely iudgeing our brethren. Are we not couetous, as they are? yet are wee proude and diſdainfull. Are we not proud? yet are we fleſhely &amp; wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Are we not wanton? yet are we ſlaunderous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull. Are we not reproachfull? yet are wee enuious and malicious. What, are we not malicious? yet are wee riotous and intemperate. What, are we not intemperate? yet are we prodigall and waſtfull. If not prodigall, yet ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and blaſphemers: if not blaſphemers, yet extortioners and oppreſſors of our brethren: Or finally, geuen to theſe and theſe iniquities; ſo that it is as cleare as the ſunne in his brightneſſe, that in many things we offend all. Which who ſo conſidereth, and pondereth in equal ballance: ſhal thereby be counterpeized, and brought to a moderate cenſure and iudgement of the ſinnes and liues of others: and taught effectually, not to vſurpe authoritie, raſhly to iudge and condemne the brethren.</p>
               <p>This I would to God our ſharpe cenſurers, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere iudgers would weigh, who geue definitiue and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorie ſentence of al men; who chalenge a chiefe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and abſolute authoritie ouer all their brethren; who condemne without charitie, whatſoeuer doeth not pleaſe them ſelues. Would God they would but turne ouer the leafe, wherein their owne infirmities are regiſtred, and turne the other ende of the wallet before them, to fixe their ſight vpon their owne blemiſhes, and blottes of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: then would their pride be abated, their heate aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaged, their chollor cooled, their iudgementes modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, their arrogancie delaied and qualified: and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues brought to a temperature: not ſo ambitiouſly to vſurpe and arrogate to themſelues, the cenſuring of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:19545:165"/>
               <p> Which to effect and compaſſe in the Saints, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle vſeth this reaſon alſo; My brethren, be not many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, knowing that we ſhall receiue the greater condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: for in many things we ſinne and fall all.</p>
               <p>Of our manifolde fallings, many are the occaſions, ſundrie are the cauſes. 1 The original corruption which lieth couched in our boſomes, wherby we are led captiue vnto ſinne.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The ſnares of Sathan, which he laieth to take vs, and intangle vs in the pitfold of iniquitie.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The euil examples which are preſented before vs, whereby we are drawen to all vngodlines euery day.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The lenitie of the gouernours of diſcipline, who (according to the rule of iuſtice) take not execution vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne: whereby others are pricked forwarde to like ſinne. For, whereas puniſhment is not executed (ſaith <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)</hi> ſpeedelie, there are the hearts of men ſet vpon miſchiefe. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.</note> Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, hee would betimes deſtroy all the wicked of the land, that he might cut off all the workers of wickednes from the citie of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Finally, the fearefulnes and flatterie of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the word: who either for feare, or for fauour, tell not men of their manifolde offences, wherby they are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned ſundrie waies to fall.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of the Apoſtle is this: Seeing all men are ſubiect to many falles and infirmities, therfore muſt they not be too ſeuere againſt their brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be not many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters (ſaith the Apoſtle) knowing that we ſhall receiue the greater condemnation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for in many things we offend all.</p>
               <p>Now the fall of man is double: either particular, or generall. Particular, as to fal into any one ſinne, or more: as theft, dronkennes, adulterie, murther, couetouſnes, vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, extortion, ſlaunder, lying, blaſphemy, and the like. Into ſome, or many of theſe, euen the moſt holy Saintes haue, may, and doe daily fall. Generall falling, is when men fall <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12</note> away, not in one onely ſinne, but generally in all: &amp; reſiſt the grace of God offered. This is apoſtacie, this is the ſin vnto death, this is the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt: euen a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:166"/> and vniuerſall falling away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the knowen trueth. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> Whereof the authour to the Hebrewes affirmeth, that who ſo doeth ſo ſinne, cannot be reſtored by repentance.</p>
               <p>And S. <hi>Peter</hi> auoucheth, that it were better for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to haue knowen the trueth: then after that they haue knowen it, to fall away from the holy commaundements. Thus doe not the Saints fall, but onely the reprobate. Of the former kinde the Apoſtle ſpeaketh; for al men fal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in many things: which we ought alwaies to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider: that it might teach vs, not to vſurpe authoritie am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiouſly to cenſure and iudge our brethren: whereunto this place and exhortation ſerueth; My brethren, be not many maſters, for we ſhal receiue the greater iudgement: for in many things we offende or fall all.</p>
               <p>Whereas Saint <hi>James</hi> willeth, that wee be not many maſters: doeth it take away the authority of maſters ouer their ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts? No aſſuredly: for then would neither S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo carefully, nor Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſo diligently, haue geuen precepts concerning obedience of ſeruantes to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth ſeruants to be ſubiect to their <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tit. Epheſ.</hi> 6.</note> maſters, and to pleaſe them in all things; to be obedient to them which are their maſters according to the fleſh, with feare and trembling, in ſinglenes of minde, as vnto the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.</note> Lord. In another place in this wiſe he councelleth them; Let as many ſeruants as are vnder the yoke, count their <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2</note> maſters worthy all honour: that the name of God, and his doctrine be not euill ſpoken of. To whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſubſcribeth: Seruants (ſaith he) be ſubiect to your maſters with all feare: not onelie to the good and courteous, but alſo to the froward. Seeing theſe Apoſtles haue enioyned this obedience to ſeruants towards their maſters; and the ſame ſpirite ſpoke in them, and in <hi>Iames</hi> our Apoſtle: it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth then, that the authoritie of maſters is not here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned.</p>
               <p>If we muſt not be many maſters, neither be iudges ouer our brethren; ſhall we thinke that power is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way hereby from Princes, iudges, and magiſtrates, ouer their Subiects, and ſuch as are vnder them? Neither. For
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19545:166" rendition="simple:additions"/> then woulde not the Scriptures teach what magiſtrates ſhould be in common wealthes, neither enioyne obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be performed vnto them. <hi>Moiſes</hi> being wearied with the gouernement of the whole people of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.</note> is taught by <hi>Jethro</hi> his father in law, the prieſt of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, to chuſe more offiicers and gouernours vnder him, whoſe qualities are foure.

                     <hi>Exod</hi> 20.</note> Which God contained in the fourth commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: where it is ſaid, honour thy father and thy mother: not onely the parents of our bodies, but the parents and fathers of the countrie, which are princes and magiſtrates in common wealthes. This obedience he requireth, when he giueth them authoritie to determine cauſes, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.</note> men to ſtande to their verdit. Our Sauiour Chriſt taught the ſame by his own example, who in toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ciuil <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 17.</note> ſubiection paied tribute to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> And afterwarde being tempted by the Scribes and Herodians, and demaunded <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.</note> the queſtion, whether it were lawfull to giue tribute to <hi>Caeſar</hi> or no? anſwered them in this wiſe: Giue to <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which belongeth to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and to God, that which belongeth vnto God. S. <hi>Paul</hi> by Chriſtes ſpirit taught, willeth euery ſoule to be ſubiect to hier powers, becauſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</note> their power is from God. Finally. S. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth all men to ſubmit themſelues to all maner humaine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> for the Lords ſake. The ſoueraintie of the prince ouer the people: the correcting, controlling, and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the magiſtrate and ciuill officer of the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and offending perſons, is not hereby remoued.</p>
               <p>VVhat if we may not bee many maſters: ſhall wee thinke that men are herehence forbidden, to profeſſe themſelues teachers and maiſters, to informe others in humaine artes, liberall ſciences &amp; faculties belonging to this life? No doubt wee may not ſo thinke: for thus
<pb facs="tcp:19545:167"/> to profeſſe is lawfull.</p>
               <p>If we may not be many maiſters, ſhall wee ſuppoſe that the office of preaching and reprouing, iudging and condemning out of the worde of God is forbidden? No, for it is a thing of all others moſt neceſſarie. Without which men would runne on headlong into all ſinne. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> therefore ſaith: he that ſinneth, ſo long as hee is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vpon the</hi> 5. <hi>chap. Ephe.</hi>
                  </note> not reproued, ſeemeth to himſelfe not to ſinne: and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces growe into maners, and are receyued in ſtead of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. The rebuking of ſinne, is a bridle and bit to reſtraine others from the like iniquitie. Which when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> conſidered, he willeth <hi>Timothie</hi> to rebuke ſuch openly, as openly offended, that others thereby might feare. S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.</note> ſaith, that when men ſinne, others knowing thereof: they muſt alſo bee rebuked in the ſight and knowledge <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 13. <hi>in Iob. cap.</hi> 4.</note> of others: leaſt if the preacher holde his peace, and be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, he thereby ſeeme to allowe of ſinne: and that growe into example, which the tongue of the miniſter cutteth not off. And as the offences of men giue incouragement to others, when they are not reproued: ſo being corrected and reproued, others are reſtrained: yea, reprehenſions out of the worde bring life: as <hi>Salomon</hi> affirmeth: corrections <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.</note> for inſtruction are the way of life. Wherfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending the moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vſe of reprehenſion, by the word of god: he auoucheth, that the inſtruction of a wiſe man, is as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 13.</note> the well ſpring of life, to turne away from the ſnares of death. Seeing therefore common reprehenſion of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God is the bridle and ſtay from ſinne, and the way whereby we come to life: and bringeth ſingular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite vnto men, it is not to be thought that the Apoſtle here condemneth it, which both the Prophets, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles alſo haue oftentimes vſed. Neither doth this place take away, the names and titles of men: the honour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men in place of honour and dignitie, due: See 1. Pet. 5. verſe 3.</p>
               <p>Finally, ſeeing we are forewarned not to bee manie maiſters, ſhall we thinke that priuate reprehenſion, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate exhortation, priuate admonition is forbidden? If it
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:19545:167"/> were ſo, why would our Sauiour, that one man ſhoulde <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.</note> tell another of his fault priuatly, for reconciliation? VVhy doth <hi>Siracides</hi> exhort men, to tell their neighbours their <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 19.</note> offences, that if they haue done them, they doe them no more? VVhy doeth God will that euerie man ſhoulde <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.</note> friendly reproue his brother? VVhy doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort vs to admoniſh one another, and prouoke one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vertue, by inſtruction and exhortatien? None then of theſe are here condemned: but wee are admoniſhed to ſurceaſſe from that maiſterlike and proude finding fault with others, when ambiciouſly wee vſurpe authoritie to iudge and condemne: to cenſure and giue ſentence of our brethren, without charitie, rigorouſly: without pitie, ſeuerely: without due regard of common imbecilitie, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterely. VVhich thing in this place condemning, Saint <hi>James</hi> giueth this exhortation: My brethren, be not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie maiſters: knowing that wee ſhall receiue the greater condemnation: for in manie things we fall all. And thus much concerning the firſt place. God for his mercie ſake graunt vs true humilitie of heart, that we humbling our ſelues before the mercie ſeate of God, may ſhewe like loue one towarde another: that wee being not too rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous towards other men, may haue regard of our owne imbecillitie and weakeneſſe of nature: that wee in true loue ſupporting one another, may be are one anothers burden, and ſo fulfill the lawe of Chriſt: who died for our ſinnes, and roſe againe for our righteouſneſſe: to whome with the father, and the holy Ghoſt, be all praiſe, dominion, and maieſtie, nowe and for euermore.

               <p>Hereof to come to the firſt member, the propoſition: <note place="margin">The propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> that man which falleth not in his tongue, is a perfect ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and able to bridle the whole bodie: it ſeemeth to haue a neceſſarie coherence, and a fit dependance with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wordes of the Apoſtle. S. <hi>Iames</hi> hath ſaide: that in many things wee fall all. Seeing then there are ſo manie falles in the life of man: &amp; men moſt eaſily of all things fal in their tongues and lippes: then which to gouerne and keepe from falling, there is nothing more difficult: therefore after that he had affirmed that in many things wee all offende: to giue a caueat againſt that miſchiefe whereunto man is moſt ſubiect, The falling in wordes:
<pb facs="tcp:19545:169"/> Saint <hi>James</hi> teacheth in the ſeconde place, that hee is a rare and moſt perfect man, and able to bridle all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which offendeth not in tongue. Not that there is any which attaineth vnto this perfection: but thereby is ſhewed howe truely it was ſaide before, in manie things we offende all. And moſt chiefly by that ſlipperie mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the tongue: wherein who ſo ſinneth not, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>Whereby the Apoſtle inſinuateth vnto vs, that the Saintes and ſeruants of God, whoſe chiefe care is not willingly to fall: muſt haue a ſpeciall regarde to their tongues, bee warie and charie ouer their lippes, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and carefull to keepe the doore of their mouthes: VVherein, of all men, is moſt eaſily offence committed. So that to bridle our tongues, to moderate our mouths: to keepe our lippes, to guide our woordes with diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; is a rare point of perfection, and a great ſteppe to excellent vertue.</p>
               <p>Howe good a thing, howe great perfection, howe rare a vertue it is, not to ſtumble in the tongue: neither to offend in worde, <hi>Sirach</hi> perceyued, when he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth <note place="margin">

               <p>It is a thing worthie praiſe, in anger to keepe our hands from fighting: in hatred to withhold our feet from ſhedding of bloud: in abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance of delicate fare, to bridle our affections and appetites from riotous luſt: in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of lewde women, to keepe our ſelues from carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: in plentie of wealth: to refraine from couetouſneſſe: in great proſperitie to be farre from pride: but the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by the tongue, being ſo eaſie, &amp; the way therof ſo ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie: not to fall in tongue and wordes, is a vertue ſo rare: a thing ſo ſeldome ſeene: as that <hi>Sirach</hi> counteth <note place="margin">

And Saint <hi>Iames</hi> eſteemeth it as great perfection, when he ſayth, Hee that falleth not in his tongue and worde, is a perfect man, and able to bridle all the bodie: which is the propoſition and ſtate of this ſecond place.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The propoſition premiſed and ſet downe before: in the next place foloweth the tractation or handling ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <note place="margin">The handling or tractation.</note> which is double. 1 From the profits of the brideled tongue. 2 From the euils of the vnbrideled tongue.</p>
               <p n="1">1 From the profites and commodities of brideled tongues: great good, and ſingular profite groweth and riſeth vnto men by moderation of the tongue, and no ſmall matters are compaſſed and brought to paſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: as by the two ſimilitudes and compariſons of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle here, appeareth.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:19545:170"/>
               <p> For to ſhewe what great matters may bee done by moderation of tongue, the Apoſtle compareth in to the bridle or bitte of an horſe. Like as the bitte is but a little thing in compariſon of an horſe, yet it guideth and ruleth the ſtrongeſt horſe that is, and maketh him followe the will of the rider: Euen ſo, the tongue is but a ſmall matter in the bodie of man, yet it (being gouerned with diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) gouerneth the whole body.</p>
               <p>Wee put bittes (ſaith Saint <hi>Iames)</hi> into the mouthes of horſes, that they ſhould obey vs, and thereby we turne about their whole bodie. Which compariſon (it may be) he borowed out of the Prophet <hi>Dauid:</hi> who exhorteth men not to be like horſes and mules, which haue no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.</note> whoſe mouthes we binde and holde with bit and bridle, leaſt they fall vpon vs. By both which places it appeareth, that horſes are guided by the bitte and bridle, at the pleaſure of the rider. Hereby the horſe is taught to runne, and to ſtay; to turne, and to winde; to leape, and to fling out; to ſtand vp, and karere; to ſcoure out; to retire, &amp; geue back; and what els ſoeuer the valiant warriour, or ſkilfull rider luſteth: yet is there not a ſtronger beaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, then the ſturdie ſteede.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding his great ſtrength, hee is turned and toſt with the bitte, at the pleaſure of the rider. The bitte being little, in compariſon of the horſe, preuaileth ſo greatly. Euen ſo the tongue, a ſmall part, and one of the leaſt of all our boidly members, guideth the whole body to good or to euill: being moderated by reaſon, then it profiteth (no doubt) greatly. This when <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> the <note place="margin">Theophrastus.</note> famous philoſopher conſidered, he ſaid not amiſſe; That it were better truſting to an vntamed and an vnbrideled horſe, then to an vnbrideled tongue: for the danger of the horſe (by not medling with him) may bee preuented: but becauſe we carrie our vnbrideled tongues alwaies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout vs, the perill and danger thereof cannot bee auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>The other ſimilitude is from the ſterne, or rudder of the ſhippe. Beholde the ſhippes alſo, although they be
<pb facs="tcp:19545:171"/> great, and driuen with fierce windes, yet are they turned about with a ſmall rudder, whetherſoeuer the gouernour luſteth. The rudder is but a ſmall peece of wood, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the whole ſhippe, yet it turneth the greateſt ſhip that is, whetherſoeuer the maſter pleaſeth: to auoide dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rockes, ſinking ſandes, and other perils, of ſea and waters, and to bring it to the deſired hauen whereunto they bende their iorney. So the tongue is a little member, yet (ruled by reaſon) it guideth the bodie, and keepeth it from falling into ſundrie miſchiefes, wherunto otherwiſe we are endangered. It is little, and ſmall, among other members of the bodie: yet it boaſteth great thinges, and is effectuall and of force to compaſſe, or at leaſt attempt great matters.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, what the bitte in the horſe mouth, is to the gouerning of his whole bodie: and the rudder of the ſhippe to keepe it from dangers: to turne it, to winde it, to direct it in all points as ſhall ſeeme beſt vnto the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: euen the ſame is a moderate tongue to the rule of the whole body. If thou drawe and plucke in the bridle, thou reſtraineſt: if thou geue the head, vnbrideled horſes will endanger thee: if thou holde wiſely the rudder, thou maiſt ſaile in ſafetie: if thou let it goe as it will, the windes take holde of the ſhippe, and carrie it into perill: if thou pluck the raignes of the tongue, thou reſtraineſt it: if thou geue libertie to the tongue, it will bring thee to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: if thou holde thy tongue with wiſdome and reaſon, thou liueſt in ſecuritie: if thou let it runne at randonne, thou ſhalt be plunged into vnrecouerable danger.</p>
               <p>Thus by theſe two familiar ſimilitudes of horſes and ſhippes; the one by the bitte, the other by the rudder go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned and directed; the Apoſtle plainly ſetteth downe, what profit and benefit redoundeth by the moderating of the tongue, vnto men: which is the firſt part of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this matter.</p>
               <p>Theſe two ſimilitudes, in the thirde, fourth, and part of the fifth, were conteined, ſet downe to ſhewe the profit <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> 2. <hi>part of the handling.</hi>
                  </note> of moderating our tongues. In the other part of the fifth
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19545:171"/> verſs, and in the other verſes to the fifteenth, the Apoſtle ſetteth downe the other part of the treatiſe, and handling of this matter: namely, how good a thing it is, to bridle and moderate our tongues; from the euils and inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences which followe the vnbrideled tongue. For as the profit of moderating our tongues is great: ſo contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the diſcommodities of the vntamed tongue, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brideled mouth, are many. Which thing he ſheweth: firſt generally, then particularly.</p>
               <p>Generallie, the euils and diſcommodities of an euill tongue, are ſet downe by two compariſons. Firſt the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed tongue is like fire: a little fire is able to deſtroie much matter: the tongue being little, yet doeth great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. A coale, yea a ſparke of fire, oftentimes hath raiſed great flames, whereby whole houſes, villages, townes and cities, woods, fieldes and forreſtes, haue beene deuoured. Coſtly buildings, gorgeous houſes, goodly cities, large kingdomes, huge countries, ample wilderneſſes, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant forreſts, by a little fire may bee ſubdued, and brought to nothing: So the tongue is a fire, which deſtroyeth and waſteth the greateſt matters. One word of the tongue hath kindled fire of hatred in mens heartes, which vntill death, hath neuer beene extinct and put out: yea, it hath cauſed ſo great a flame, as hath deſtroied many people, and burnt vp many Nations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that with S, <hi>Iames</hi> wee may worthely compare it to fire.</p>
               <p>Which to ſignifie, it may be that God almighty hath made it of forme, colour, and faſhion, like vnto a fire. The tongue is ſharpe, rounde and ſmall at the tippe, or toppe: but greater, wider, and broader downeward: So fire, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is ſharpe, ſmall, rounde: but greater, larger, and broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der downeward: So that the vpper ende of the flame is ſharpe; but the nearer wee goe to the matter whereon it feedeth, or burneth; the larger, wider, and greater, is the flame and fire. Wherfore, in ſhape and forme, the tongue is like fire.</p>
               <p>The tongue in colour is reddiſh: ſo is the colour of the fire: ſo that therein they agree together. The fire is
<pb facs="tcp:19545:172"/> ſwift, and runneth ſpeedely, ſending out flames, nowe this way, now that way: So the tongue runneth and rouleth this way and that way: is ſwift alſo and nimble, ſending out ſound farre and neare; and therefore not vnlike vnto fire: ſo that for many like reſpectes it may not amiſſe bee compared vnto fire.</p>
               <p>Now as it is compared vnto fire, ſo is it called a world of wickednes. It is a ſea of ſinne, a pitte of vice, without bottome, a maſſe of miſchiefe, &amp; the originall or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cauſe of manifolde euils: ſo that verye heathen poets and perſons, haue confeſſed it the cauſe of all euill, as the Poet <hi>Menander</hi> did. <note place="margin">Menander.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is a world of wickednes, becauſe moſt miſchiefes, and greateſt ſinnes among men, by vnbrideled and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked tongus are determined, attempted, and perfourmed. By the tongue theeues conferre together, talke and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of robberies: manquellers and murtherers by their tongues raiſe vp braulings, the cauſes (oftentimes) of cruell murther. By their tongues adulterous and lechea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous perſons, firſt tempt the chaſtitie of others, and with their wordes agree vpon the wickednes. By the tongue, lying, diſſembling, flatterie, and counterfetting, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. By the tongue, ſlaunder, backbiting, ſwearing, blaſphemie and periurie, is vttered. By the tongue, falſe ſentence is pronounced, either to the condemning of the righteous, or abſoluing of the wicked: both which are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable before the Lord. By the tongue, men are led into errour through falſe doctrine: drawen to wickednes <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 17.</note> by lewde councell. Through the tongue, by falſe reports, priuate men and princes, kingdomes and countreis, townes and cities, ſocieties and families are ſette at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. By the tongue, familiars and frendes haue beene ſet at daggers drawing, and their quarrels thereby haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in bloud.

With filthines of ſpeach it corrupteth: with diſſembling and flatterie it deceaueth: with lying and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19545:172"/> cogging it beguileth: with falſe reportes it ſlaieth: with ſlaunders it defameth: with vain ſwearing it blaſphemeth: with inticing it inueigleth: with ſmoothnes of talke it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth: yea almoſt euery wickednes among the children <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 28.</note> of men, is either determined, attempted, executed, or fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the tongue. Inſomuch that <hi>Sirach</hi> hauing great experience, falleth into a large diſcourſe of thoſe euils which come of the wicked tongue: as, that it hath deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many which were at peace; that it hath diſquieted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and driuen them from nation to nation; that it hath broaken downe ſtrong cities, and ouerthrowen the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of great men, abated the ſtrength of the people, and beene the decaye of mightie nations; that it hath caſte downe many vertuous women, and robbed them of their labours; that it cauſeth, that ſuch as hearken vnto it, ſhall neuer reſt and liue quietly; that it ſtriketh deeper then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rodde, and deuoureth more then the ſworde of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, and ſuch like. All which, and the like miſchiefes, the Apoſtle in generall ſpeech conteining, calleth it a world of wickednes. And thus by theſe two compariſons the apoſtle ſheweth the great diſcommodities of tongues vnbrideled in generall.</p>
               <p>Now, as generally the vnbrideled tongue cauſeth great euils, and miniſtreth matter of great miſchiefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men: So particularly, the diſcommodities of vnta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med tongues are three. 1 The euill tongue defileth the whole bodie. 2 It is vntameable. 3 It is geuen to ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and reproach of the brethren. Which are three great euils.</p>
               <p n="1">1 It is ſaid to be ſo ſet among the members, that it defileth the whole body, and ſetteth on fire the courſe of nature, and is ſette on fire of hell. How great an euill is this?</p>
               <p>That it defileth the whole bodie, it appeareth: Our <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaking of the ineuitable, and incurable miſchiefe of the euill tongue, ſaith; It is as the ſharpe arrowes of a mightie man, and as the coales of iuniper. Where the man of God compareth the tongue to dartes caſt, or to arrowes ſhotte of men moſt mightie, which ſtick deeper: and to the coales of iuniper, which, both burne ſoner, and keepe fire longer. Such is the force of the viperous tongue, as it ſetteth on fire the courſe of nature, and it ſelfe is ſet on fire of hell: the deuill himſelfe kindleth it, Sathan himſelfe (for whom hell fire is prepared) beeing both a lyer and a ſlaunderer from the beginning: vſeth the tongue oftentimes as his inſtrument: and blowing it with the bellowes of all miſchiefe, ſendeth flame there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, whereby it burneth to great deſtruction: as he ſet on fire the tongue of the ſerpent to deceiue the woman: then <note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2 As the tongue defileth the whole bodie, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on fire the courſe of nature, it ſelfe ſet on fire of hell: So is it a thing vntameable, and vntractable. For whereas the whole nature of beaſtes, and of birdes, and of cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping things, and things of the ſea, is tamed of the nature of man: yet the tongue cannot be tamed: It is an vnruly thing, full of deadly poyſon: more vnruly then the beaſts of the field; more vntameable then the birdes of the aier; more vntractable then the venemous ſerpents; more ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, and more ſuddenly gone then the fiſhes of the ſeas, and waters; more hardlie gouerned then any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for all theſe are tamed and made milde and meeke by mans wiſdome, practiſe, diligence, vſe and labour:
<pb facs="tcp:19545:174"/> But of al creatures the tongue is moſt diſordered, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tameable.</p>
               <p>And for beaſtes, though they be moſt cruell, ſauage, and vntractable by nature: yet by practiſe, vſe, induſtrie &amp; labour, are they tamed. Beares, Panthers &amp; Leopardes, Woolues, Tygers and Lions: inſomuch that ſome of the Romane Emperors haue had of theſe beaſtes to run, and drawe in their chariots and coaches. Other princes haue Lions made ſo tame, that they might play with them as with ſpaniels, whelpes, or beagels. The Tyger which was ſent from India, to <hi>Anastaſius</hi> the Prince, was made meek and tame in like manner.</p>
               <p>Birdes, and Foules of the aier are made tame by like manner. The crowe, the rauen, the hauke, the feſant, the eagle, the vulture, the parrat, the pigeon, and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the like; are ſo tamed, as that they will ſitte on fiſte, eate at hande, come at the lure of him that keepeth them. Serpents, adders, ſnakes, and creeping things haue beene tamed: the aſpis, and venemous ſerpent in Africa, whoſe ſting is incurable, hath beene ſo tamed by a certain houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, as that he came daily out of his caue and denne, to take meate at his table. Snakes haue beene ſo meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as that men haue carried them without danger in their boſomes. The fiſhes of the waters haue beene ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as that the Dolphin hath beene familiar, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him that well deſerued: the Carpe, the Tench, and ſuch fiſhes, are made ſo tame, as to bee readie to receiue meate at the hands of their maſters, as ſome men haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
               <p>Thus the beaſtes of the fielde, the birdes of the aier, the ſerpents of the earth, the fiſhes of the waters, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by the trauell, vſe, and induſtrie of man: though by nature they were not familiar, yet vſe and cuſtome, trauel and labour hath woonne it. But the tongue, more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tameable and vntractable then theſe are, cannot be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned nor made tame by man: being more barbarous then beaſtes; more wilde then birdes; more vntractable then ſerpents; more inſenſible then fiſhes of the ſeas and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19545:174"/> waters: more cruel then lions: more hurtfull then beares: more byting then woolues: more bitter then tygers: more fierce then leopardes: for of all theſe, and the like, ſome at ſometimes haue bene tamed: but the tongue is a thing moſt vntameable. Either becauſe no man is able to tame the wicked tongue of another: for ſpeake ſome men or women faire, or deale with them roughly: entreate them gently, or handle them ſharpely: pray them daily: or ſtrike them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually: thou ſhalt remoue life and breath ſooner out of their bodies, then ſpeach from their tongues, or make them ſilent: Either becauſe no man is ſo perfect, as can keepe his tongue at all times, but that therein ſometimes hee offendeth. Thus is the tongue an vntameable creature, an vnruly euill.</p>
               <p>That it is called an vnruly euill: men muſt not therefore giue it all ſcope, to doe and ſpeake what it liſt, becauſe it is vntameable, and vnrulie: but looke howe much more vnruly it is: ſo much more ought it to bee reſtrained: &amp; ſeeing it is a thing that paſſeth our ſtrength, either ſometimes to tame the tongues of others, either alwayes to bridle our owne tongues: therefore ought wee more earneſtly to pray to GOD to guide our <note place="margin">

Which the prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> viewing: and marking carefully the deadly hurte which by wicked tongues are done vnto men: compareth them to Adders poyſon: affirming that Adders poyſon is vnder the lippes of the vngodly. For looke what poyſon and venime is in venemous things: as the Scorpion, Crocodell, Baſiliske, Adder, and venemons Serpents: in plantes, hearbes, rootes, as in Cicuta, which being like the Hemlocke, by extreem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of colde killeth: which the Athenians vſed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting puniſhmentes vppon men: And <hi>Photion</hi> was
<pb facs="tcp:19545:175"/> made to drinke that, and ſo periſhed: being enuied of his vnkinde Countrie-men the Athenians. And it may bee that the ſame poyſon was the ende of famous <hi>Socrates:</hi> who beeing enuied for his vertue, and glorie of thoſe <note place="margin">Socrates.</note> which were then in chiefe authoritie: was accuſed by <hi>Anytus, Meliſſus</hi> the Poet, and <hi>Lycon</hi> the otator, for ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king agaynſt their idoll gods, and ſo drunke poyſon, and dyed. Or looke what venome is in Aconitum, Long-wort the roote wherof maketh neeſing powder in blacke Poppie, which killeth by ſleepe: or in Colloquintida, or wilde Gourdes, which ſlayeth a man by vehement and ouer-great purging: what deadlie hurt is in any of theſe, or the like: no leſſe is in a venemous and wicked tongue: ſo that the Prophet by his experience could ſay truely: that the venome of Aſpis was vnder their <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140. <hi>Jame.</hi> 3.</note> lippes. And Saint <hi>James</hi> by his knowledge: that the wicked tongue of man, is full of deadly poiſon: as lyes, blaſphemie, falſe doctrine, hereſie, errour, deceyte, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, falſe accuſations, euill reportes, ſlaunders, contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies, filthie talke, and infinite the like, whereby the ſoules of men are often poyſoned and venomed to death: and the poyſon thereof is moſt daungerous, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue then any poyſon.</p>
               <p>For the poyſon of the Scorpion is only ſuch, as hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them alone whom he ſtriketh with the tippe of his taile: the Viper infecteth none, but ſuch as hee biteth with his venemous teeth: the Crocodile and Baſiliske killeth none, but ſuch as they retch and fetch of, either with the ſharpneſſe of their ſight, or the ſtrength of their breath. Venemous rootes, hearbes, plantes, infect none, but thoſe which either touch, taſte, ſmell, or handle ſome of them: But the tongue ſtingeth and ſtriketh: infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and poyſoneth: killeth and deſtroyeth, at hande and farre off: at home and abroad: by ſea, and by land: in time of peace, &amp; in time of warre: our friends, and our foes:: ſuch as meddle not, as well as ſuch as meddle: ſuch as haue not to doe, as ſuch as haue to doe with it. ſo that no place is ſo farre in diſtance: no loue ſo neere by
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19545:175"/> friendſhip: no man ſo bound by duetie: no one ſo deare by good deſert: whom the poyſoned tongues of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, doe not, or hath not moleſted. Thus for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tameableneſſe, vnrulineſſe, and hurtfulneſſe, is the tongue moſt daungerous: and this is the ſeconde euill in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of the tongue, wherefore it ought to be reſtrained, the vntamable crueltie, with deadly venomouſneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">

               <p n="3">3 The laſt and third particular euill here, is that it is reprochfull and ſlaunderous: giuen to curſed bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: therewith we bleſſe God, and curſe, backebite, and ſlaunder our brethren: therefore it muſt bee refrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And this is an euill euen in thoſe which pretende greateſt godlineſſe: who pretende they ſerue, loue, feare, and worſhippe God: bleſſe, prayſe, and magnifie him: yet doe they curſe, reproch, ſlaunder and reuile their brethren, which can not be. For no man can bleſſe and praiſe God aright, and yet curſe and ſpeake euill of his neighbour. For that bleſſing and prayſing God, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a curſing, in that that it proceedeth from an euill and ſlaunderous perſon whom God hateth, and of whom he denieth, ſo much as to be named.</p>
               <p>Which thing hee prooueth by two reaſons. 1 No man can giue glorie to God, and prayſe him in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and yet reuile, curſe, reproch man, the chiefeſt of the creatures of God on earth, framed and faſhioned in the chiefe part of him, in the ſoule, to the verie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblaunce and image of God himſelfe, as <hi>Moſes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth. <note place="margin">

The ignominie and reproch done to man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth vnto GOD: to whoſe likeneſſe man is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. VVhereby it is euidently apparant, that no man can rightly bleſſe God, who curſſeth or ſlaundereth man. Which Saint <hi>James</hi> noteth, when hee reaſoneth from things vnpoſſible: therewith bleſſe wee God euen the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therewith curſe we men, which are made after the ſimilitude of God.</p>
               <p>If God then be bleſſed in his creatures, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayth, God is faithfull in all his ſayings, and to be bleſſed in all his works: and man the moſt excellent of all Gods creatures vppon the vniuerſall face of the earth, onelie <note place="margin">

Let all men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men herehence learne an infallible truth, a reſolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, a ſingular poynt of wiſedome: that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende Gods Religion in vaine, that they honour not, woorſhippe not, ſerue not, bleſſe not, ne yet glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie GOD aright, ſo long as they are giuen to curſed ſpeaking, reprochfull ſlaunder, bitter backebiting one of another.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Dauid</hi> the princely Prophet weighing, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the Lordes Tabernacle, from the holy hill of <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.</note> If they ſlaunder their brethren: to which purpoſe hee ſayeth in this wiſe to the wicked: What haſt thou to doe to take my ordinaunces in thy mouth, and declare my couenant, ſeeing thou hateſt to bee reformed, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſt my woordes behinde thee? VVhen thou ſeeſt a
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:19545:176"/> theefe, thou runneſt with him, and art partaker with the adulterer: thou giueſt thy mouth to euill, and with thy tongue thou forgeſt deceyte. Thou ſitteſt and ſpeakeſt agaynſt thy brother, and flaundereſt thy mothers ſonne: theſe thinges who ſo doe, haue not to declare or ſpeake of Gods ordinaunces, or to take his couenant in their mouthes. They pretende religion, they ſhewe a countenaunce of godlineſſe, they ſet a face of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: they ſeeme to be deſirous to praiſe and bleſſe God: yet they ſlaunder and curſe their brethren. This no man can doe: for no man can rightly honour the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter, which ſpeaketh euill of the worke: no man can praiſe the Creator, which reuileth his creature: no man can bleſſe GOD, which curſeth men, made to the image of God himſelfe: If they in whome the generall image is, ought not to bee curſed: much leſſe they in whom the ſecond and ſpeciall reſemblance appeareth.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Nowe as this cannot be, by the reaſon from the worke to the worke maiſter: from the image, to him whoſe image it is: from the reſemblaunce or patterne, to him whoſe patterne and reſemblaunce it is in deede: ſo in like manner ſheweth hee the impoſſibilitie of this, by an argument from contraries: the order and courſe of things, which God the eſtabliſher of nature hath ſet, will not ſuffer contrarie effectes to proceede from the ſame cauſe: things in nature oppoſed, and repugnant in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treeme contrarietie: cannot agree together, and be at one in the ſame thing. Now, to bleſſe and curſe; to praiſe and ſlaunder, are things contrarie; therefore can they not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in one tongue, at once together. And this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth euidently by two ſimilitudes, whereby the matter is amplified and enlarged. I As the fountaines and heades of waters, iſſuing and ſpringing from the ſame place: cannot ſende out ſweete water and bitter. 2 And as the figge tree cannot bring foorth Oliues, nor the vine tree, figges. Our Sauiour himſelfe confirming the ſame, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.</note> when hee auoucheth that good woorkes cannot come, from an euill man, no more then thornes come of grapes
<pb facs="tcp:19545:177"/> or figges of thiſtles, which were againſt nature. So neither can bleſſing and curſing come out of one mouth: praiſe, and diſpraiſe: ſpeaking well and ſlaundering: god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and impietie: truth, and falſehoode. Curſing, and bleſſing are contrarie, ſo that they can not agree in one mouth and man together, but it were as monſtrous as for ſweete water, and bitter, to come at once natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the ſame fountaine: and for the ſame tree to beare figges and oliues: grapes and figges together. As euerie tree in nature beareth one kinde of fruite, and not diuerſe and ſundrie: much leſſe the fruite of other trees: ſo muſt the tongue haue her proper effect, fruite and worke, and that one, not diuerſe, much leſſe contrarie: it muſt bleſſe therefore both God and man, and curſe no bodie, as <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth.

For as ſweete and bitter wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, mingled &amp; blended together, the bitter eaſily taketh away the nature of the ſweete: and as honie and poyſon tempered together, the poiſon farre leſſe in quantitie tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the honie: ſo when curſing and bleſſing are in one mouth together: the bitterneſſe of the curſe, turneth the ſweeteneſſe of the bleſſing, and maketh it odious before God. Wherefore it is apparant, that we can not bleſſe God, if wee curſe and ſlaunder our neighbour. The doctrine of this place, may then bee this: that with this inſtrument and member, which is the tongue, there is no duetie acceptably perfourmed vnto GOD, when thereby wee harme or hurt our neighbours and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Whom when we thus harme, if we thinke to pleaſe God, wee deceyue our ſelues through hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>And thus much concerning the moderating of the tongue: both in reſpect of the profites, and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities thereof: which out of this place may bee ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to haue obſerued: ſpecially ſeeing in the firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, verſe 26. and in the next Chapter, beeing the

               <p n="1">1 Of theſe foure, the firſt is the exhortation to meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <note place="margin">The exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> inferred and brought in by the way of an interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Who is a wiſe man (ſaith he) and indued with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge among you? Let him ſhew by good conuerſation the meeknes of wiſdome. As who ſhoulde ſay; All men ſeeke to be counted wiſe; but if any wil be wiſe in deede, let him by meeknes ſhew his wiſdome: For therin indeed wiſdome conſiſteth.</p>
               <p>The occaſion of this exhortation may be the ſinne which the Apoſtle in the firſt place condemned: namely, that many chalenged authority to themſelues, to reproue and checke their brethren, and to bee as cenſurers ouer them: thereby ſeeking the opinion of wiſdome among men: which (notwithſtanding) were themſelues enuious, and contentious.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>James</hi> here (to abate their pride, to beat downe the arrogancie of their ſpirites, to aſſwage their malice, and to coole the heate of their madnes and furie,) telleth them, that it is not the way to be counted wiſe, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but rather that herin wiſdome conſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſteth, that they ſhew themſelues modeſt, quiet, meeke, and gentle, in their whole conuerſation.</p>
               <p>This place condemneth the ſophiſticall ſcholemen;
<pb facs="tcp:19545:179"/> this condemneth the brauling Anabaptiſts; this condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth al ſuch, whoſe liues are ſpent in contention of words; this condemneth popiſh perſons, ſeditious ſeminaries, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous Ieſuits, the vain, curious, &amp; contentious men of out time: who geue themſelues to tumults, contentions, ſeditions, diſſencions, brauling and brabling moſt deadly: to the diſturbance of the commonwealth, diſquietnes of the church, ſlaunder of the goſpel, hurte to priuate ſtates and conditions of men. In which practiſe wiſdome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth not, but in meekenes. Chriſtian wiſdome is not in ambitious vſurping authoritie ouer the brethren: neither in quarrellous braulings &amp; contentions about trifles: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in vnbrideled pride and arrogancie of ſpirite: neither in tumultuous vprores, and diſquieting of the people: nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther is it ſillogiſtically and ſophiſtically to ſtriue about words, neither inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to oppoſe our ſelues againſt ſuch as are in chiefe authoritie: neither ſtandeth it in fooliſh affecting of rigorous ſeueritie: But in gentle behauiour, in tractablenes of life, &amp; meekenes of conuerſation: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apoſtle telleth vs; Who is wiſe, and indued with knowledge among you? Let him ſhewe by good conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, his works in meekenes of wiſdome.</p>
               <p>Meekenes is a vertue moderating pride and anger, repreſſing deſire of reuenge, forgetting offences, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning iniuries, for priuate and publique quietnes ſake. Whereunto our Sauiour Chriſt exhorteth, pronouncing <note place="margin">

               <p>The contention betwixt <hi>Haimo</hi> and <hi>Haniball</hi> the Carthagenians, was the ouerthrow of their famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention betwixt the Numantians, was the onely cauſe they were ouercome by <hi>Scipio:</hi> who

               <p>In the Church it is no leſſe peſtilent and pernicious.

So that in the common wealth, in priuate ſtates, in the Church it ſelfe, great hurt commeth through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Wherefore with all carefulneſſe it ought to bee ſhunned of the Saints of God.</p>

The Apoſtles for the ſame cauſes had fundrie conflicts and combates in their times.

                     <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> all theſe contentions were godly.

So then, not all ſtrife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending is euill, and oppoſite to meekeneſſe: but that which breaketh loue, alienateth the mindes of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, renteth in ſunder the bond of peace, cauſeth diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among Chriſtians, and is againſt the rule of equitie, and this is condemned.</p>
               <p>Yea to varie in opinion of ſundrie things: in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fultations and deliberations to diſagree: to iarre and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent one from another in diſputations of ſchooles: plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in court of lawe, ſo that they bee without bitter ſpeaches: without ſpuing out of rancour and poiſon: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wreaking of our wrath, and malice of our hearts:
<pb facs="tcp:19545:184"/> without vp braiding, reuiling, taunting, defaming and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing one the other, is not forbidden.</p>
               <p>This bitter enuie, hurtfull and vncharitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and ſtrife, whereby loue is broken, peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie diſturbed and hindered: are the two euils oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to meekeneſſe: whereunto who ſo is giuen, boaſteth in vaine of wiſedome, and lyeth falſely agaynſt the truth. For the Goſpel which is an abſolute truth, ſheweth that onely to be true and ſound wiſedome, when flying bitter enuie, ſhunning contentions and ſtriuings, repreſſing and keeping downe deſire of reuenge: we ſhewe by good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation our woorkes in meekeneſſe of wiſedome. And this is the oppoſing of theſe two vices to the vertue of meekeneſſe: the ſeconde thing in this diſcourſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Theſe things thus ſet downe, in the thirde and next place, the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth of wiſedome, and <note place="margin">A diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> ſetteth each foorth by Epithites and additions, by their qualities and markes of difference: there is one wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome earthly, another heauenly: that condemned, and this commended among men. Vnto this diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is he neceſſarily brought. For where contention, ſtrife, and brawling commonly growe of pride, and pride is vſually puft vp with opinion of our owne wiſedome: hauing ſpoken of contention, the effect of pride: he hath iuſt occaſion to ſpeake of wiſedome, the falſe opinion whereof, is oftentimes cauſe of pride among men: and ſo diſtinguiſheth of wiſedome, as that he ſtoppeth and ſhutteth a doore or gate againſt manifolde miſchiefes. The wicked couer and colour their brawlings, brabble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, contentions and ſtriuings vnder a cloake of wiſedome: whoſe mouthes to ſtoppe our Apoſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth: that if to haue bitter enuying and ſtrife in our hearts: if to burne and boyle in hatred: if to bee giuen to contentions, brawlings and diſturbing of peace be wiſedome as manie men account it: yet it is but earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſedome, ſenſuall and diueliſh: and ſo deſerueth not the name of wiſedome but vnproperly, and as
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19545:184"/> men tearme it vndeſeruedly, and commeth to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of wiſedome: one is earthly, ſenſuall, and diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh: the which is wicked: ſuch wiſedome may bee in brawlers, and contencious perſons: another heauenly, holy, and diuine: and this is onely in the true Saints of God.</p>
               <p>Concerning the former which is wicked wiſedome, <note place="margin">Wicked wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</note> (if wee may call it wiſedome after an vnproper ſpeach, and by the common ſpeach of men ſo calling it:) it is diſcribed here by three qualities or properties. 1 It is earthly: ſuch as ſmelleth and ſauoureth altogether of the earth, and of the worlde, and of worldly demeanour and manners. The wiſedome of earthly and worldly minded men, is to be proude, contentious, quarellous, giuen to reuenge euerie treſpaſſe, euerie offence, euerie iniurie: herehence it is that ſuch are counted wiſe, which take no wrong at any mans hande: that put vp no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, which will be auenged by force and might. They are contrariwiſe called fooles, ſillie men, innocents, which beare iniuries againſt them committed. Inſomuch as when we are iniuried, and reuenge not: the worldlings ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, What fooles are you to ſuffer it? If we bee ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and euil ſpoken of, and render not ſlaunder for ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, reproch for reproch, rebuke for rebuke: then ſay they alſo, What fooles are you? If hee had ſaide ſo by me, I would haue had him by the eares: or I would haue ſpent an hundred pounde, but I woulde haue tamed his tongue, and made him eate his worde. Thus the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded men countbitter enuie, and contentious braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and dayly ſtriuing with men, wiſedome. VVhich if we graunt to be wiſedome: yet is it carnall, fleſhly, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and earthly. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hereunto agreeth: who condemning the ſame fault in the Corinthes. VVho not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding boaſted of their wiſedome, ſayeth in this <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> wiſe vnto them: Where as is among you, enuying, and ſtrife, and diuiſions, are you not carnall and walke as men? This is wiſedome after a manner: yet earthly not heauenly: carnall, not ſpirituall: from beneath, not
<pb facs="tcp:19545:185"/> from aboue: worldly, not godly. With this falſe and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured wiſdome many puft vp, thinke it the beſt way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide iniuries: to put vp nothing, but reuenge euerie quarrell: and the onely way to obtaine their willes, to cut it out of the whole cloth, to quarrell with euerie one: to be at endleſſe debate, and deadly contention with men: this is farre from meekeneſſe: this is called wiſedome: but this wiſedome, (ſayeth Saint <hi>Iames)</hi> is onelie earthly.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As earthly, ſo is this wiſedome ſenſuall: naturally blind in heauenly things: ſuch whereunto by common ſenſe men are caried as bruite beaſts: who ſuffering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries one of the other, foorth-with either ſtrike againe, or puſh with horne, or bite and teare with mouth, and ſo are auenged. Such wiſedome it is to bee quarrellous, contentious, and giuen to reuenge. This wiſedome is <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</note> not purged, but corrupt with euill affections of nature: this proceedeth from thoſe who beeing ſenſuall and carnall men: men naturall not regenerate, perceyue not the things of GOD, neither can they vnderſtand them, becauſe they are ſpirituallie diſcerned. This is a part of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> the wiſedome of the fleſh, which is enmitie with God, and neither is, neither can bee ſubiect to him. This <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai</hi> 5.</note> is a poynt of ſelfe-wiſedome, where againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet denounceth vengeaunce: wo to them which ſeeme wiſe in their owne eyes, and prudent in their owne ſight. Thus to doe, wee haue of our mother witte, and fathers wiſedome, euen from our prime, parents, and firſt fathers, from whome wee drawe all malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, enuie, and iniquitie. Hereunto our owne ſenſe mooueth: our owne deſire leadeth, our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture pricketh, which wee haue ſucked with our concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> and is altogether ſenſuall and naturall.</p>
               <p>To giue our ſelues then to bitter enuie, to brawling &amp; contention, to ſtrife and emulation: to truſt in our owne wits, to flatter our ſelues in our owne conceit, to ſtand too much vpon our pantiples: to be quarrelous; through pride
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:19545:185"/> to chalenge authoritie ouer other men, and not to abide the checke of anie: to ſtriue and contend with euery one, is wiſedome in a falſe perſwaſion of men: but wiſedome worldly and wicked. VVherewith who ſo are indued, are carnall not ſpirituall: ſenſuall not regenerate: hauing not the ſpirit, but led with their owne ſenſualitie as beaſts in whom is no reaſon: this the Apoſtle to intimate, telleth vs that this wiſdome is ſenſuall alſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Finally, and thirdly, it is diueliſh. The originall of enuie and contention, wherein the wicked worldlings repoſe wiſedome: is from Satan himſelfe, the authour, the fountaine, the well-heade of maliciouſneſſe, enuie, contention, debate and ſed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tion among men: whereunto onely through him, are men mooued: Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calleth this wiſedome diueliſh, becauſe it is not inſpired by God, but ſuggeſted by Satan: not infuſed from heauen, but powred into vs from beneath: not inſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the father of light, but miniſtred vnto vs by the prince of the darkeneſſe of this world: and therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led diueliſh.</p>
               <p>Satan was contentious from the beginning: lifting vp himſelfe euen againſt God through the inſolencie of his minde, for which hee was caſt downe from heauen: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jude v.</hi> 6.</note> and is reſerued in euerlaſting darkneſſe to the iudgement of the great day. He was a murtherer from the beginning, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.</note> as Chriſt witneſſeth: from whome all enuie, hatred, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, debate and contention aryſeth. He is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the enuious man: who ſoweth tares among the corne <note place="margin">

By him was the ſedicious contention of <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> cauſed: by him were <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> ſtirred vp to withſtand <hi>Moiſes:</hi>

                     <hi>Num.</hi> 16. <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 11. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 8.</note> by him the bellowes of all brawlings were blowne in the Phariſies and Scribes, to contend and ſtriue agaynſt the open truth of Ieſus Chriſt: by him were the malicious Iewes pricked forwarde to withſtande and contende agaynſt the Apoſtles and preachers of the Goſpell:
<pb facs="tcp:19545:186"/> by him were the heretiques hatched, who contended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Catholike fathers in the primitiue Church: by him were the proude Popes and prelates of Rome rayſed vp, to ſowe the ſeede of ſedition in all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſtendome: by him are now contentious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſtirred vp to diſturbe the peace of Hieruſalem: by him rebels riſe vp againſt lawfull Princes: princes are ſtirred vp one againſt another for couetous deſire, and ambition of minde, each to ſeeke the caſting downe of each others crowne and kingdome: by him are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men ſet at deadly variance, and prouoked often to the ſhedding of the blood of their brethren: by him all contention and ſedition, all brawlings and brabble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all fallings out and quarrels, in priuate ſtates are cauſed: ſo that we may right well conclude with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, that wiſedome, to contention: ſtrife, and debate, in whatſoeuer kinde it be: is from the diuell, and therefore diueliſh: and theſe are the qualities and properties wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Nowe as the worldly and wicked wiſedome is by properties noted: ſo is it alſo ſet downe by effects, which follow contention and ſtrife. Whereof Saint <hi>Sames</hi> ſayth: where enuying and ſtrife is, there is ſedition and all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of euill workes. Whereby he teacheth, that ſedition and all maner of euill workes enſue and follow conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſtrife among men: and therefore ought it with all carefulneſſe and diligence be auoided.</p>
               <p>That ſedition and all maner of euill workes proceed from enuious aed contentious wiſedome (in few wordes) it appeareth out of <hi>Salomon,</hi> who witneſſing that when <note place="margin">

The contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Lacedemo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; Athens ended in ſedition. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> enuious contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> raiſed ſparks of ſedition among the people. <hi>Silla</hi> &amp; <hi>Marius</hi> contention ended in ciuil diſſention. The like may be ſaide of Caeſar and <hi>Pompey: Anthonie</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> and infinite the like: whoſe contentions and enuie hath ended in ſedition. This is true in the Commonwealth: This is true in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate ſtates of men: This is true in the Church of Chriſt: This is true in all ſtates and degrees; ſo that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith truely; that where enuie and ſtrife is, there is ſedition and all manner of euill workes.</p>
               <p>Seeing then contention, enuy, &amp; ſtrife, cauſeth ſedition and all manner of euill works: The wiſdome which vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth contention, ſtrife, and enuie, may worthely bee condemned: which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> doeth, both in deſcribing the qualities, and ſetting downe the effectes: If you haue bitter enuying and ſtrife among your ſelues, reioyce not, neither be liers againſt the trueth. This wiſdome diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not from aboue, but is earthly, ſenſuall and deueliſh: For where enuying and ſtrife is, there is ſedition, and all manner of euill workes. And thus he painteth out wicked and worldly wiſdome vnto men.</p>
               <p>Now as there is wiſdome which is wicked: ſo alſo is <note place="margin">Godly wiſdom.</note> there godly wiſdome, whereof Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith; Bur the
<pb facs="tcp:19545:187"/> wiſdome that is from aboue, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be entreated, full of mercie and good fruites: without iudging, without hypocriſie. Where the Apoſtle in eight properties ſetteth downe this heauenly wiſdome vnto men.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Of which properties and qualities the firſt is: It is pure, it defendeth innocencie, puritie, and integritie of life; it nouriſheth charitie, and foſtereth cleannes in the whole conuerſation of man: whereby all ſuch are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, who chalenge vnto themſelues the name of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet are impure, vnchaſt, vncleane in their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: In wordes filthie, in workes ſhameleſſe, in geſture and behauiour outwardly, abhominable: in their mindes corrupt, in their bodies looſe, in their whole life lewde and licentious. Who herence are taught by the Apoſtle, that what wiſdome ſo euer they pretend in the ſight of men, yet are they cleane void of heauenly wiſdome: whoſe firſt propertie is to be pure.</p>
               <p>Then all adulterers, all fornicators, all inceſtuous and vncleane perſons, all thoſe who geue themſelues to fleſhly impuritie, are voide of wiſdome; yea and guilty of follie. Therefore <hi>Ammon</hi> going about to ſatisfie his luſt vpon <hi>Thamar</hi> his ſiſter, ſhee diſſwaded him in this wiſe; <note place="margin">2. <hi>Kings</hi> 13.</note> Force me not my brother, committe not this follie: and I, whither ſhall I cauſe my ſhame to goe? and, thou ſhalt be one of the fooles of Iſrael. When <hi>Sichem</hi> had defloured <hi>Dinah</hi> the daughter of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> hearing thereof, were ſore grieued, becauſe he had wrought follie <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. <hi>Iudges</hi> 20.</note> and villainie in Iſrael. the abuſing of the Leuite his wife, by the Beniamites, was called follie, and abhomination in Iſrael.</p>
               <p>If they whoſe liues are impure be voide of wiſdome, and ſuch as geue themſelues ouer to fleſhly vncleannes, be reputed fooles: how many are the fooles of England, ſeeing therein ſo many adulteries, ſo many fornications, ſo great vncleannes is euery where committed? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, our ſpeeches, geſtures, behauiours of bodie, are witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes moſt manifeſt. Let men and women therefore pretend
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:19545:187"/> neuer ſo great wiſdome; let them ſeeme neuer ſo graue, ſage, diſcreete: yet if their liues be ſtained, either with fleſhly luſt, or any other iniquitie whatſoeuer: they are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly voide of all heauenly wiſdome: whoſe firſt quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is puritie. Men then which will be partakers of this wiſdome, muſt retaine a pure and chaſte minde in their breaſts, and pure affections in their hearts: that they may embrace that wiſdome from aboue, which is pure.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As it is pure, ſo is it peaceable: not contentious, nor quarrellous: it nouriſheth quietnes; it foſtereth peace; it cheriſheth concord; it ſeeketh after amitie and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with all men. <hi>Abraham,</hi> indued with this wiſdome, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.</note> being prouoked by <hi>Lots</hi> heardmen, was notwithſtanding, peaceable: for the which things ſake he deſired <hi>Lot</hi> there might be no falling out betwixt them: and therfore deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, gaue choiſe to his nephew to go which way he would. <hi>Iſaac</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Abraham</hi> indued herewith, ſhewed himſelfe peaceable towards <hi>Abimelech</hi> &amp; his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">

This wiſdome was in the holy Prophets, in the bleſſed Apoſtles, in the renowmed Martyrs, in our onely Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt; who hauing many iniuries, not only intended, but done againſt them: yet as much as lay in them, folowed peace with all men. This was in the princely Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> who followed after peace with <hi>Saul,</hi> and his enemies. And this is in all the true Saintes <note place="margin">Pſal.</note> of God, as much as is in them, to nouriſh peace, and ſo they ſhewe their wiſdome: whoſe ſeconde propertie here is, to be peaceable.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb facs="tcp:19545:188"/> 3 Neither is this wiſdome peaceable onely; but meeke and gentle: which qualitie appeareth partly in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a charitable iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of other mens offences: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in geuing place to the wiſe reformation and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Elders: whereby they are condemned as fooles, who neglecting this quality of wiſdome, to be gentle: and refuſing to be inſtructed, thinke themſelues wiſe inough, that they need not to learne any further.</p>
               <p>Theſe haue forgotten that all our knowledge here is vnperfect, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; They remember not, that how much ſo euer a man profiteth in knowledge, yet there is <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>Ambroſ. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>off. c.</hi> 1.</note> none but he needeth to learn ſo long as he liueth, as ſaith S. <hi>Abroſe.</hi> Follie it is, not wiſdome therfore, to refuſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The heauenly wiſdome of god therfore is gentle, in cenſuring other men; gentle, in tollerating iniuries; gentle in receiuing inſtruction from the mouthes of the wiſe: wherein who ſo ſheweth not gentlenes, is a foole, and hath not taſte of heauenly wiſdome.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Againe, this wiſdome is tractable, eaſie to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated; eaſie to be reconciled: whereof they are voide al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, who long time retaine hatred, and keep malice in their hearts: whom neither the threatninges of Gods word, neither Chriſtian ſubmiſſion, neither brotherly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, neither neighbourly admonition, neither friendly perſwaſion, can winne to be reconciled.</p>
               <p>This wiſdome our Sauiour Chriſt, the very wiſdome of his Father, in whom the fulnes of al wiſdome doeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, <note place="margin">

Wherein we drawe neare vnto the diuine wiſdome of God, whoſe properties the Scriptures noting vnto vs, among others, witnes, that he is eaſily entreated; that hee chideth not continually, neither keepeth his anger for euer; but is ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue <note place="margin">

Wherefore they alſo are farre from this wiſdome; whoſe propertie it is eaſilie to be entreated.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Another qualitie or propertie of this wiſdome is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai</hi> 55 1. <hi>John</hi> 2</note> mercy: it is full of mercy, and mercy is ſpecially in two things. 1. in pitying the bodily needes of our brethren in pouertie and diſtreſſe, whereof is largely ſpoken. 1. chapt. verſe 27. 2. In pitying the ſpirituall needs of the ſaints, and of all men: as when they lacke good councell, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter it: when they run aſtray, to call them home againe: when they offend to tell them of it, that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed: to draw them by all meanes out of the ſnare of ſatan, whereby they otherwiſe might be caried away to their deſtruction. Whereence it appeareth that the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue hath a mercifull regard, both to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and alſo to the ſoules of the ſaints of God: whereof if wee become careleſſe, then haue wee not that wiſedome, which is full of mercie.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The ſixt propertie hereof is: that it is full of good workes: as conſtancie in profeſſion; pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in afflictions; carefulnes in our vocation; continuance in prayer; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the fleſh; renouation of the ſpirite; reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our life; and finally whatſoeuer tendeth to true ſanctification.</p>
               <p n="7">7 It is alſo without iudging: which is either without
<pb facs="tcp:19545:189"/> reſpect of perſons to regard the matter; 2. chapt. 1. Ether without ambition and rigour in iudging thy brethren; 3. chapt. 1. Either without greedie and buſie inquiring, &amp; ſeeking into other mens liues: either iudging all in the worſt part: either vnaduiſedly to iudge or condemne one another. Theſe kinds of iudgings, either partially, either ambitiouſly, and rigorouſly; either curiouſly; either mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly; either raſhly: are here condemned. Not taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a right eſtimation and iudgement betwixt man and man; thing and thing; good and bad; truth and falſhood; iuſtice and iniurie; oppreſſion &amp; equitie; or any the like, either eccleſiaſticall or ciuill iudgement.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Finally, this wiſdome from aboue is without hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. This doth nothing colourably or counterfetly: ſuttlely or guilefully: this wiſdome beareth not two faces vnder one hood: this wiſdome pretendeth not one thing openly, and meaning another ſecretly: this doth al things plainely and purely, ſimply and ſincerely: as proceeding from God the God of truth: to whome no diſſembling; no counterfetting; no double dealing is or can be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and theſe are the properties of heauenly wiſedome. By this diſtinguiſhing of wiſedome, he ſtoppeth the dore and gate to all impuritie; to all contentiouſnes; to all ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſnes and deſire of reuenge; to all ſtubbornnes to be corrected or informed; to all irreconciliablenes, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractablenes of men; to all vnmercifulnes; to all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; euill iudgement, hypocriſie, &amp; diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling before God and man.

               <p>Theſe things being thus diſpoſed, the laſt thing in this treatiſe is, why wee ſhould ſhewe by good conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our workes in meekenes of wiſedome; becauſe the fruites of righteouſnes are ſowen in peace of them, which make peace, a reaſon from reward, in ſo much as they ſhal reape the fruites of righteouſnes, which they haue ſowen in peace.</p>
               <p>This place teacheth vs, that whatſoeuer we do, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:19545:189"/> good or euill, it is a ſeede ſowen, whoſe fruite hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is to be expected, if the ſeede be good, we ſhall receiue <note place="margin">

Which ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> confirmeth; be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, God is not mocked; for whatſoeuer a man ſoweth that ſhall he alſo reape; if he ſowe to the fleſh, hee ſhall of the fleſh reape corruption; if he ſowe to the ſpirite, he ſhal of the ſpirite reape life euerlaſting. That they may receiue pleaſant and delectable fruite from the liberall hande of God, the Apoſtle exhorteth them to ſowe good ſeede, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the ſeede of peace, that they may receiue and reape the reward of peace, mentioned by our Sauiour, which is <note place="margin">

               <p>And this reaſon is ſet downe to perſwade the ſaints to embrace peace, againſt the corrupt iudgement of the world, who iudgeth them miſerable, fooliſh &amp; wretched, that liue peaceably: but the ſpirit of truth teacheth here the contrary: that hovvſoeuer the vvorlde iudgeth of peaceable perſons, yet ſhall they aſſuredly in due time reape and receaue the reward of peaceable righteouſnes. Which reward ought to allure all men to meekenes of wiſdom: which ought of chriſtians ſo far foorth to be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, as a good conſcience be retained; vice and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſuppreſſed; vertue and godlines promoted; loue and charitie in the holy feare of God cheriſhed: And this is peaceable wiſdome by the Apoſtle commaunded.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this fourth Chapter, the holy Apoſtle goeth on with the matter of brawling and contention, in the ende of the former Chapter diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of: ſetting downe other cauſes of contentions and warres among men, which he condemneth. The whole Chapter may be reſolued into
<pb facs="tcp:19545:193"/> foure braunches or members. 1 Is touching contention. 2 Touching our duetie to God. 3 Concerning humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 4 Is the reproofe of two euils proceeding of pride.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt there are fiue things. 1 A queſtion. 2 An anſwere. 3 A condemning of vaine pleaſures, as voide of effect. 4 The rendring of cauſes, why they are void. 5 A bitter and ſharpe reprofe of thoſe things. And theſe are contained in the ſixe former verſes.</p>
                  <p>In the ſeconde place, touching the duetie of men to God, there are two things wherin it conſiſteth. 1 Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, wherein there are three things. 1 What is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. 2 The contratie. 3 The reaſon: 2 Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching and drawing neere to God: wherein there are three things alſo. 1 A precept. 2 A promiſe. 3 Howe the thing is to be done. v. 7. 8.</p>
                  <p>The third part is of humiliation: and thereof are two branches: 1 Chaſtiſing our ſelues, wherein two things are to be conſidered. 1 What he commaundeth. 2 How it is to be done: by ſorowing, weeping, turning laughter into mourning, and ioy into heauineſſe. 2 Point of dutie to God, is caſting downe our ſelues before God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therein are two things: the precept: the reaſon. And this part is abſolued in the 9. and 10. verſes.</p>
                  <p>The fourth part is the condemning of two euils of pride: 1 the one is euil ſpeaking: 2 The other vaine confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. In euill ſpeach, two things are noted. 1 What is forbidden. 2 Why it is forbidden. The reaſons are foure. 1 Thereby the lawe is violate and iniuried. 2 it is the duetie of Chriſtians to doe the lawe: not to iudge it, as in ſlaundering and ſpeaking euill of their brethren they doe. 3 Hereby men vſurpe Gods office. 4 Al men are of fraile condition, therefore ought they not to ſpeake euill one of another. 2 The other euill of pride is, vaine confidence, when men long before, without good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, will determine of things: therein are fiue things 1 VVhat is condemned. 2 VVhy wee ſhoulde not ſo vainely truſt. 3 A correcting of the euill. 4 The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating of it, with reproofe. 5 The concluſion.

Are they not (ſayeth he) herehence, euen from your pleaſures, which fight in your members? This ſecond interrogation, with the wordes in the next verſe: ye luſt and haue not: yee enuie, and deſire immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: containe the aſſigment of the cauſes of warres, broiles, contentions among men: and the cauſes, are aſſigned here two: vnruly pleaſures fighting in the members of men: and immoderate deſire. If therefore we demaund beſide that which before hath beene ſpoken. Chapter 3. 14. 15. 16. verſes: what furthermore is cauſe of braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, brabblements, contentions, and warres among men: we may anſwere aright: either the vnruly pleaſures, or the immoderate deſires of increaſing our priuate wealth and eſtate: for from theſe two fountains and well heades, all contention commonly ariſeth. The vnru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and immoderate deſire of honour: the infinite deſire men haue to encreaſe their owne eſtates, whereby they are caried headlong to thoſe things which ſeeme plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, delectable, glorious, and profitable vnto them: chiefly moue and pricke men forwarde to contention, and quarrelling, brawling and fighting: Inſomuch as that Saint <hi>James</hi> demaunding the queſtion, from whence warres and contentions ariſe: anſwereth, euen from the pleaſures which fight in mens members.</p>
               <p>And howe truely, vnrulie pleaſures, and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate deſires are cauſes not onely of priuate quarrels, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, broiles and contentions: but alſo euen of open warres in deede: experience ſufficiently doth teach vs: ſo that there is nothing almoſt more manifeſt, then, that the fulfilling of our luſts: the enlarging of our honour and worldly pompe: the encreaſing of our priuate vvealth, is cauſe of contentions and vvarres among men.

The vnregenerate parte ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth againſt the regenerate: the olde <hi>Adam</hi> againſt the newe Man; the outwarde Man againſt the inwarde, ſo ſo that there is in the Saints a ſtriuing and a fighting in their members.</p>

               <p>Where vnruly pleaſures and immoderate luſts are aſsigned cauſes of warres and contentions, which cauſes beyng euill, the effectes cannot be good; vvee may not therence condemne all contention, neyther all vvarres as vnlavvfull.

               <p>Thereof Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith: yee luſte and haue not: you enuie and deſire immoderately, and cannot obtaine: yee fight and warre and get nothing.

               <p>One man ambitiouſly deſireth honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> another couetouſly hunteth after gaine and commoditie: this man aymeth at a kingdome; another ſhooteth at promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: one followeth his carnall deſire, another ſeeketh after other pleaſures: euery one either for greedy gaine &amp; priuate increaſe; or for ambitious deſire of augmenting his honour: trouble, excruciat and vexe themſelues mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably; and yet all in vayne: For theſe their vnruly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and immoderate deſires are very often fruitleſſe, and without effect: as experience teacheth vs. Some men ſeeke by their greedy deſire to attaine vnto great wealth; therefore they toyle &amp; moyle themſelfes, &amp; at yeares end get nothing. Yea ſometimes looſe that they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: as thoſe that will occupie many trades; ſet vp many

               <p>Such alſo are they, which hauing very good &amp; gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full trades, whereof they liue well; yet for greedines of gaine, they betake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnto other trades: as the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupier, when after many yeares he wil play the marchant aduenturer (for ſo he doeth oftentimes) aduentureth all, and bringeth home nothing but a heauie heart, a fooles head, experience dearely bought, repentance too late, the prouerb of fooliſh, had I wiſt, I would not haue done it. Theſe and ſuch like (ouer greedie of haſtie wealth) loſe their labours oftentimes, and profite themſelues nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Some in like manner, hauing aſpiring heartes and mindes, caried away with ambition, ſeeking increaſe of honour: come to confuſion, ſhame and ignominie: as <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom,</hi> not content to be the kings ſonne, but hunting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">2. <hi>Kings</hi> 18</note> the kingdome before his time, tooke ſword in hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his father, and was miſerably confounded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.

               <p>Finally, ſome ambitiouſly bent to enlarge and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe <note place="margin">3. <hi>Kings</hi> 23.</note> their kingdomes, haue either loſt their liues and labours, as <hi>Achab</hi> for his indeuour for Ramoth Gilead: or haue ſpent more by ſeeking them, then gained by the recouery of them: or finally, keep thoſe kingdoms, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treies, or prouinces (whereunto they haue aſpired) with greater labour and coſt, then either comfort to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or commoditie vnto their people: and ſo they haue not obteyned their purpoſe.</p>
               <p>This hath fallen out in former times: this I truſt will fall out by the helpe of God, to barbarous Turkes; cruell Saracens; bloudie Spaniards, and ſuch ambitious perſons. Thus no doubt, in theſe, as in a light ouerſhadowing, wee ſee, how truely the Apoſtle affirmeth, that the vnrulie pleaſures, and immoderate deſires of men, are oftentimes without effect: ye luſt, and haue not; ye enuie, &amp; deſire im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderatly, and cannot obteine; ye fight and warre, &amp; get nothing.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſons folow, why ſuch deſires of men are voide of their effects commonly: and for the moſt parte, <note place="margin">Why the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of men are voide of effaecti.</note> fruſtrate: and the reaſons are two. 1.

When <hi>Salomon</hi> had from God choiſe geuen him, what he would aske; he asked wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <note place="margin">3. <hi>Kings</hi> 3.</note> to gouern his people: which thing ſo pleaſed god, as that God therefore ſaid vnto him; becauſe hee had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked neither long life, nor riches, nor the life of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, therefore he would geue him alſo that which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not: both riches and honour. Therefore the ſonne of <hi>Sirach</hi> referreth riches to God, as the geuer thereof. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie <note place="margin">

               <p>The firſt reaſon why mens deſires concerning wealth and honout are oftentimes voide: is becauſe they aske not theſe things from the hands of God, whoſe gifts they are: but they ſeeke them by their owne meanes; by euill waies; by vnlawfull trades; by wicked endeuours. Thus one by fraud, another by force; one by violence, another by villenie; one by this euill meane, another by that, goe about and ſeeke to attaine to wealth and honour: but they ſeek not theſe in the fear of god, nor at his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them, therefore full oft their purpoſes are fruſtrate. Thus men luſt, &amp; haue not the thing they luſt after: they enuie, and deſire immoderately, yet obteine not that which they deſire, and whereafter they enuie. They fight, they warre, they ſtriue, they ſtruggle, they toile, they moile: yet compaſſe not, nor comprehende that, which they laboure thus after: becauſe they aske it not of GOD, but ſeeke by euill meanes to obtaine it: They acknowledge not God the geuer of theſe things, therfore they labour in vaine. They luſt, they enuie, they deſire, they fight, they warre; yet they obteine not, becauſe they aske not.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as men hauing any thing in their power and hand to geue, looke to be asked and deſired the gifte thereof: and thinke them vnworthie the benefit, which thinke themſelues too good to craue and deſire it: and therefore men often miſſe thoſe things they woulde full faine haue, becauſe they ſeeke not to the geuer, but goe about by other meanes to obteine them: Euen ſo God, though he geue many things vnasked, eſpecially to his ſeruants, and ſometimes vnto the wicked: yet woulde hee for his riches and honours be ſought vnto; and thinketh
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:19545:199"/> them vnworthie his ſingular benefits, who thinke ſcorne to deſire them: wherefore they ofttimes miſſe of their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe they ſeeke to obteine it otherwiſe, then by praier vnto God, who geueth theſe thinges onely, vnto men. Which reaſon Saint <hi>Iames</hi> here ſetteth downe in the firſt place, why men luſt &amp; deſire after things which they obteine not, becauſe they aske them not of God.</p>
               <p>Now as this is ſpecially applied here by Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> ſo may we more generally conſider of it: and as it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen here for a reaſon why honour and riches (whereafter men ſeeke) are not alwaies attained: ſo may it be a reaſon certaine and ſound in other thinges innumerable, that therefore we attaine not vnto them, becauſe we ſeek them not from God. We haue no children, and we deſire them, but we obteine not: for we ſeek by ſome ſlibber ſlabber, or other deuice, to obtain the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god. We haue not our health of bodie, and we deſire it, but wee obtaine it not, becauſe we ſeeke to cunning women, which for the moſt part are arrant witches: or to skilfull Phyſicions, in whom we put our confidence; and by whom (not by God) we look to obteine it.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, generally in all other things, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in enery one, this is a iuſt cauſe of not obteining: becauſe we aſke not the things we would haue, from god, the only geuer of all good things.</p>
               <p>Where Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, that men obteine not the things which they deſire, becauſe they aske them not: we may herence learne how neceſſarie a thing it is to pray in all our needes, and neceſſities to God, for the ſupplie of our wants. Wherof hath beene ſpoken Chap. 1. verſe 8. ſermon 3. fol. 25. Sermon 27.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The ſecond reaſon why men luſt and deſire, but obtaine not, becauſe they aske theſe things amiſſe; to lay them out vpon their pleaſures. They deſire and aske ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to ſpend them lewdly: they would haue honour, to abuſe it ſhamefully. Thus they aske, but they aske amiſſe, to ſpend and lay out riches vpon their pleaſures: that is,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:200"/> to euill vſes, to euill purpoſes.</p>
               <p>This reaſon is added by the way of preuen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing an obiection: theſe men might haue ſaid: Doe not we aske? yea, aſſuredly we aske, and we aske dayly, and yet o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>taine not. Wherefore ſayeſt thou, O bleſſed Apoſtle, that wee obtaine not, becauſe we aske not?</p>
               <p>Hereunto Saint <hi>Iames</hi> anſwereth: well it may bee that you aske: but when you doe aske, yet you aske a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe: for you aske theſe things, and Gods good bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, to ſpend them vpon your pleaſures, to euill vſes, to euill purpoſes: therefore though you aske, yet you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not.</p>
               <p>God, who is rich to all ſuch as call vpon him, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to heare men, but yet ſo, as that they pray according to his will, and a right: but when we pray amiſſe, he will not heare vs. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, that what ſoeuer we aske ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.</note> to the will of God, wee ſhall obtaine it. If then we aske not aright, neither according to Gods will, then may we not looke to obtaine the thinges wee pray for. Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> writing vpon the wordes of Chriſt in the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vpon</hi> 7. <hi>Matt.</hi>

If hee that asketh ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: and he that ſeeketh, finde; and it be opened to him that knocketh; then to whom it is not giuen: who fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not, and to whome it is not opened: it is apparant that he hath not asked, ſought, knocked as he ſhould: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the words of this Apoſtle: you aske and haue not, becauſe you aske amiſſe.</p>
               <p>Many other cauſes there are, why men (deſiring and asking things from God) yet doe not obteine the thinges they aske. 1 They which aske, are oftentimes wicked: and ſuch God heareth not, though they multiplie ſundrie praiers.</p>
               <p>The Lord therefore ſaid to the wicked Iewes, that he would not heare them, though they poured out many <note place="margin">

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19545:200"/> Chapter witneſſeth, that God woulde not turne to ſundrie people: hauing regard to the manifold tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which they had committed, for which hee woulde ſhewe no fauourable countenaunce vnto them, neither <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mich.</hi> 3.</note> heare them. The Prophet affirmeth that God woulde not heare the wicked people, which hated the good, &amp; lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the euill: oppreſſed their brethren by cruell extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and plucked their skinnes from their backes: and their fleſh from their bones, and chopt them in peeces as fleſh to the pot, and meate to the caldron. The blinde man in the Goſpel, reſtored to ſight by Chriſt, whom the <note place="margin">

VVhereby it appeareth, that the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of men, is one cauſe vvhy they are not heard of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Sometimes men aske and obtaine not, becauſe they themſelues are hard hearted vnto others, and will not heare them. <hi>Dauid</hi> auouching that God reiecteth <note place="margin">

VVherefore when vvee will not graunt the humble and needfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the poore afflicted: when wee are ſo ſtrait laced: ſo maliciouſly minded, ſo hard hearted, that wee will heare no ſuite made vnto vs: our ſelues may often crie and not bee heard, and ſundrie times aske that wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not: For God is not commonly woont to heare ſuch as diſdaine the cries of their poore brethren.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19545:201"/>
               <p> 3 Sometimes men aske thoſe things which are hurtfull vnto them: therefore not to aske them were wiſedome: but when we aske them, not to obtaine them, is mercie from God. The Iſraelites asked meate for their <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 11.</note> luſt: in anger it was giuen, which to haue denied had bene mercie. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith therof: that God denieth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 121.</note> things in mercie, which in wrath he giueth. If then wee aske euill things, it is his louing kindneſſe not to graunt them. VVherein God dealeth with men, as a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der father with his children: if a childe aske an euill thing, the father denieth it in loue: if he aske a cole of burning fire: a ſharpe poynted, or ſharpe edged knife: if hee aske poyſon for honie: a Scorpion for an egge: for an Eele, a Serpent: or whatſoeuer other thing bee hurtfull: if hee loue his childe, hee will denie it: euen ſo when wee not knowing what or howe to aske aright, deſire hurtfull things from God: in mercie hee heareth not, but denieth our praiers. When <hi>Plato</hi> conſidered that men through ignoraunce oftentimes deſire hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note place="margin">In Alcebiade</note> things, which being graunted were euill to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: hee proteſteth this to bee the beſt forme of praier: which he gathered out of the olde Poets: <hi>Iupiter</hi> king, giue vnto vs praying, and not praying: vowing and not vowing: thoſe things which are beſt: and commaunde that euill things bee farre from vs, though wee deſire them. Thus the heatheniſh Philoſopher ſawe, that it was not good to be heard, when men pray for, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire hurtfull things. If the heathen deſired not to bee heard when they prayed for euill things to their gods, which indeede were no Gods: ſhall not wee repute it a great mercie, from the eternall and euerliuing God, to haue our prayers denyed, when wee deſire things that are hurtfull? Men therefore praying for things hurtfull to themſelues, are in mercie repelled and denied. Which things if we ſhould obtaine at the hands of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> God ſhould ſhew himſelfe an enemie, rather then a louing father. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Sometimes we aske things vniuſt, vnhoneſt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull:
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19545:201"/> would wee God to graunt our prayers? Some men aske the liues of their enemies: ſome men aske the goods of their brethren: ſome men aske the vnlawfull vſe of ſtrange women: ſome men aske their owne death: ſome men the death of their children: ſome aske agaynſt charitie: ſome agaynſt equitie: ſome againſt honeſtie: manie againſt pietie and vertue. And therefore they haue the repulſe at the handes of God. Wherefore it ſhall bee good and profitable for men, throughly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in themſelues to aske onely good things at the hands of God, leaſt they receyue the deniall. For men asking vniuſt, vnlawfull, vnhoneſt things, are not heard at the handes of God: and there petitions are voide and of none effect.</p>
               <p>When an importunate or rather impudent ſuter came to <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> the king, earneſtly entreating him in a certaine matter, and ſaide; Sir, might it pleaſe your grace, you promiſed me ſuch a thing: Truth, quoth the king, ſo the thing were honeſt and iuſt that thou requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; otherwiſe I ſpoke it, but promiſed it not. The ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter replied and vrged further: It becommeth a King to perfourme euerie worde of his mouth, yea, if it were but a becke or nodde of his heade: To whome the king an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: no more, ſayeth hee, then it becommeth him that will craue any thing of a king, to aske onely that is rightfull and honeſt. And thus the king cut off his ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſuter. VVoulde God all Kings, Queenes, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, woudle denie all ſutes, vnhoneſt, vniuſt, vnlawfull, or ſuch as tende either to priuate hurt, or publike harme in their kingdomes. Shall a mortall man, and earthly king: ſhall a heathen which knewe not God aright, denie ſutes which are vniuſt: and ſhall not GOD our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly King denie ſuch ſutes and petitions as are vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, vnhoneſt, vnlawfull, vniuſt, when they are made vnto him? God beeing righteous, delighteth onely in righteouſneſſe, and equitie: VVherefore he will not admit wicked, vniuſt, and vngodly prayers made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19545:202"/>
               <p> 5 As for theſe cauſes the prayers of men are put backe and repelled with God: ſo alſo, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, when we aske amiſſe, to conſume and lay out theſe things vpon our vaine pleaſures. Thus when we pray, it is no maruel that we be denied. Wherby it appeareth, that in euery prayer which we would to be of force and effectual, wee muſt haue a chiefe regarde and reſpect to the ende vvherefore vve pray.</p>
               <p>The endes of godly prayers, are, as I ſuppoſe three: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The endes of lawfull pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</hi> 3</note> our owne neede: the want of others: the glorie of God. VVhich endes if wee reſpect in the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſires of our heartes to GOD, wee ſhall bee heard according to his will. If wee regarde other endes then in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can bee iuſtifyed, no maruaile that wee obtaine not.</p>
               <p n="1">1 And firſt, in prayer wee muſt reſpect our owne neede, which either is in things inwardly and touching the ſoule: which beeing the more excellent part, ought firſt of all to bee conſidered, and thoſe things chiefly to bee ſought, which appertaine to the ſaluation thereof: as the moſt excellent gift of fayth, repentaunce, loue, good woorkes, pardon of ſinnes, pacience in aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, lowlineſſe in proſperitie, peace of conſcience, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuraunce of hope, ioy of the holie Ghoſt, and the like: whereof our Sauiour Chriſt aduertiſeth vs: firſt of all ſeeke the kingdome of GOD, or of heauen, and the righteouſneſſe thereof, and all other things ſhall bee <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.</note> miniſtred vnto you. Of which things we ſhoulde haue ſpeciall regarde, in as much as wee are but ſtraungers <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.</note> here, and haue no citie of abode, but looke for another, in the kingdome of Chriſt, wherin is the dwelling of Gods Saints for euer.</p>
               <p>Either elſe our neede is in things outwarde, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our bodies, for the competencie of things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, it is alſo lawfull to pray-Looking therefore vnto our bodily neede, for the ſupplie of that our want, wee may pray without offence to God. <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſe man reſpecting this ende, prayed neither for much <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou</hi> 13.</note>

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.</note> ſhould dayly pray, for their daylie breade, whereunder all needefull things for this life are comprehended. Thus may wee pray for meate, for drinke, for health of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, deliueraunce out of priſon, proſperous ſucceſſe in common affaires, and all other the like: according as our need ſhall be. For our owne wants and needes therefore, we may pray to God for temporall things.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As the ſupplie of our owne wants is one ende in prayer reſpected: ſo alſo may wee pray for temporall things, that our brethren may by vs bee ſuſtained. VVherefore, when I deſire a competent ſtate of liuing, not onely to mainetaine my ſelfe, and mine owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie: but that I alſo may haue whereby to releeue my needie neighbour, I pray not amiſſe. For if it be a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thing, rather to giue, then to receyue, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>

               <p n="3">3 Finally, in our prayers, wee muſt ſet the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of GOD before our eyes: ſeeking his glorie in all things: alwayes bearing in minde Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> moſt <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.</note> graue and diuine counſaile: VVhether wee eate or drinke, or what ſoeuer other thing wee doe, let vs doe all to the glorie of GOD. This ſhall wee beſt doe, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Kings</hi> 15.</note> when we referre our ſelues wholy to the will of GOD. As <hi>Dauid,</hi> who deſiring deliueraunce from the vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall dealing of <hi>Abſalon,</hi> and to bee reſtored to the Tabernacle of GOD: yet hee referreth all to the will of GOD, to doe with him as ſhoulde ſeeme <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:19545:203"/> that the bitter cuppe of perſecution, yea of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion might paſſe from him: yet ſaid he, not my will O father, but thine be fulfilled. Theſe endes in our prayers ought we to reſpect if we will looke for any thing at the hands of God, or haue our praiers heard of him.</p>
               <p>But if we reſpect other and worldly ends, our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhalbe voide and without effects: when then we pray with the mother of <hi>Zebedeus</hi> childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that either our ſelues or children may ſit at the right or left hand of Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting our owne ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not, either our owne need, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 20.</note> or the aide of other, or the glorie of God; we are worthy with her, to be repelled: when we deſire to bye the gift of the holy Ghoſt with monie as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did; thereby <note place="margin">

Thus to pray for riches to fulfill our filthie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to oppreſſe our poore brethren; to craue honour, that we may liue without checke as we luſte our ſelues; to afflict others vvhich are inferiour vnto vs: this vvere to aske amiſſe, to ſpent the thinges vvee aske vppon our pleaſures: yea it vvere great impudencie to deſire the help, patronage and fauour of God in thoſe things, vvhich ſhame reſtrayneth to make knovven to others: in vvhich order vvhen vve pray, vve are not only not heard of God, but alſo ſometimes ſeuerely puniſhed.

               <p>Wherefore as they which haue giuen their faith mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, and plighted their trouth each to each other, and haue ſo knit the knot of matrimonie, and are ioyned in honourable mariage together: leauing their owne lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, ioyne themſelues in ſtraunge loue, are adulterers and adultereſſes, and ſo both called and counted: euen ſo they, which by ſolemne proteſtation haue in baptiſme betrouthed themſelues to GOD, leauing him, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing themſelues to the ſtraunge loue of the worlde, and worldly thinges: commit adulterie agaynſt GOD:

               <p>Thus to loue the world immoderately, as doe the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, is to hate God; to profeſſe friendſhippe thereto, is to proclaime warre againſt God; to geue our ſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately to worldly things, is to play the adulterers, and adultreſſes againſt the Lord: for which thing, here men are ſharply reprooued; Yee adulterers, and adultereſſes, know you not, that the amitie of the worlde, is enmitie with God?</p>
               <p n="2">2 The reproofe premiſed, the reaſon followed, why the luſtes and deſires of worldly thinges ſhould be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and cannot bee followed without adulterie againſt God: and the reaſon is from contraries; the loue of God, and of the world, are contraries: therfore they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together, neither conſiſt in one and the ſame perſon. For if we loue the world, we muſt needes hate God: and if we loue God, we muſt hate the world: we cannot loue both at once, and together: for the amitie of the world, is enmitie with God: and he that maketh himſelfe a friend of the worlde, profeſſeth (as it were) open hatred againſt God.</p>
               <p>The loue of the world is, for men to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues ſeruants and ſlaues to worldly deſires, and corruptions. The loue of God is, to preferre him before all things, and wholly to dedicate our ſelues to his ſeruice, in holines &amp; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 1.</note> righteouſnes, acceptable before him. Betwixt which two, there is ſuch contrarietie, as how much a man is inclined to the one, ſo much hee declineth from the other: how much he is wedded to the world, ſo much he is alienated from the Lord. For as a woman, the more ſhee groweth in loue with another man, the leſſe loue ſhe hath, and the leſſe liking of her husband, whom in fine ſhe hateth, and loatheth: Euen ſo we, rauiſhed with worldly deſires: the more we loue them, the leſſe we loue God: by the meanes whereof, in fine we alſo hate him.</p>
               <p>And as a wiſe husband cannot abide his Spouſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly
<pb facs="tcp:19545:206"/> to ſport and play with an adulterer: neither wil he part ſtakes in matrimoniall and ſecrete dueties of mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, with any other: ſo neither will God, and our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, ſuffer vs his ſpouſe, to dallie and ſport with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and this preſent world: wherby we runne a whoring from him. O then you adultreſſes, and adulterers, who are tickled with the inticements, choaked with the cares, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed with the loue of worldly luſtes: know you not that the loue of this world is enmitie with God: and that in louing the world, you growe in hatred with God?

               <p>How contrarie theſe two loues be; and how impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it is for vs, to loue both God and this world at once, and together: it may appeare by our Sauiour himſelfe, <note place="margin">

If any man loue the world, the loue of the father is not in <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6</note> him. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> rightly demaundeth (as a matter impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) what fellowſhippe hath righteouſnes with vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes; what communion hath light with darkenes; what concord hath Chriſt with Beliall? God being righteous, hath no fellowſhip with the worlde, which is wicked, and lieth altogether in ſinne: God being light, and the father <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5 <hi>Iames</hi> 1 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4</note> of lights, in whom alſo there is no darcknes at al, hath no communion with Sathan, the prince of the darckneſſe of this world.

It is God that ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in his Apoſtle: it is the ſpirit of truth, which infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vs: it is Chriſt in his miniſter, that openeth his mouth and aſſureth vs: that whoſoeuer will be a friend of the world, maketh himſelfe the enemie of God.</p>
               <p>Seeing then there is ſuch contrarietie betwixt the loue of God, and of the world, as who ſo making friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the world, procureth hatred with God: it is meete therefore that all profeſſed Chriſtians, ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe themſelues to the renouncing of worldly loue, and ſeeke to holde faſt the knotte of Gods loue without wauering, that we may remaine his friends for euer.</p>
               <p>The caſe therefore thus ſtanding with men, that who ſo ſeeketh the friendſhip of the world, therby profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth hatred againſt God; it appeareth manifeſtly, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men and women which profeſſe chriſtian religion, are notwithſtanding enemies vnto God. For whoſoeuer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe the friende of this worlde, thereby profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelfe, or at leaſt maketh himſelfe in deed the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of God; and moſt men and women ſeeke dayly the friendſhip of this world; as the couetous, prowde, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton perſons: ambitious men, adulterers, fornicatours, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane perſons: vſerers, extortioners, oppreſſours, dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, ſurfetters, liers, blaſphemers, ſlaunderers, and the reſt <note place="margin">

Whom the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle therefore reproueth; Ye adulterers, &amp; adultreſſes, know you not that the amitie of the world, is enmitie with God? Whoſoeuer therefore will be a friend of the world, maketh himſelfe the enemie of God. This is the voice of God, therefore muſt wee heare it: it is the ſonnde of the ſpirite of trueth, therefore muſt we obey it: it is Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus which thus reprooueth in his ſeruants, therefore muſt
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:19545:208"/> we beleeue him. And this is the reproofe of theſe deſires, and the reaſon, wherefore they muſt bee auoided of the children of men, becauſe they purchaſe hatred with God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The laſt and thirde thing in this fourth braunch of the firſt part of this Chapter, is a preuenting of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection in the fifth and ſixt verſes contained. They might haue ſayde to Saint <hi>Iames:</hi> O bleſſed Apoſtle, howe is it that thou in heigheſt againſt theſe deſires ſo ſharpely, as to repute them for wicked adulterers and adultreſſes, which ſeeke and followe after them? are not theſe ſuch as nature hath engraffed? Being therefore naturall, they ought not with ſuch ſharpeneſſe, ſuch bitterneſſe, ſuch ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemenice to be reproued.</p>
               <p>Hereunto the Apoſtle anſwereth: doe you thinke that the Scripture ſayeth in vaine: The ſpirite that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in vs, luſteth after enuie? But the Scripture offereth more grace: and therefore ſayth; God reſiſteth the proud, but giueth grace vnto the humble. As who ſhoulde ſay. True it is, that we are giuen to theſe vices naturally, and the Scripture confirmeth the ſame: yet doth not this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe vs, but rather howe much more vehemently wee are by corruption of nature, caried away with theſe things: ſo much more diligently muſt wee beware of them. Neither ſhall our labour therein be in vaine, but ſhall receyue a full rewarde: in as much as GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the proude, ambicious, couetous, which hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe deſires, and leaue him: and alſo miniſtreth grace, ſendeth helpe, giueth ayde to ſuch as are humble, and in true lowlineſſe of minde, cleaue inſeparably to him.</p>
               <p>Let vs a little vnfolde and rippe open the wordes, where he ſayeth; Thinke you that the Scripture ſayeth in vaine? VVhat meaneth the Apoſtle here by the worde, Scripture? Surely hee may thereby meane and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande ſome place either of the olde, or of the newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, though the place bee not manifeſt, neither this ſentence verbatim, worde for worde, as it lyeth here, there to bee founde: ſo that this meaning may bee well
<pb facs="tcp:19545:209"/> gathered out of any place, as no doubt it might. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit then this Scripture it ſelfe can no where be found in holy Scripture: yet ſeeing it may therhence be gathered, it is inough: and therefore he calleth it Scripture. The Apoſtles had this libertie, not only to giue out the plaine place of any Prophet, or of Chriſt himſelfe, for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but alſo that which might bee gathered out of ſuch places, they haue in their writings tendered for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 38.</note> vnto poſteritie. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Epheſians at Miletum, alledgeth for Chriſts ſaying this: It is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thing to giue, rather then to receyue. VVhich Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not orderly written, nor ſpoken by Chriſt in any place: yet may it bee gathered out of diuerſe places of the Scripture in effect: and therefore as Scripture he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth it.</p>
               <p>In like maner, in the Epiſtle to the ſame Church and congregation, faith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> (after many exhortations <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.</note> and arguments, to perſwade them to holineſſe and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of life:) therefore he ſaith: awake thou that ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and ſtand vp from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall giue you light. This Scripture worde for worde is no where to be founde in any place of holy Scripture: yet becauſe it may bee gathered out of diuerſe places of <hi>Jſai,</hi> as out of the 9. Chapter 2. verſe. 26, chap. ver. 19. 60 chap. ver. 1. or the like, either in him or other: as ſundrie are of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie opinions thereaboutes: therefore hee alledgeth it for Scripture. Saint <hi>James</hi> in like maner gathering this Sentence out of the Scripture, though worde for worde it bee not there to bee founde, alledgeth it for Scripture, and ſo calleth it: Doe you thinke that the Scripture ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in vaine: the Spirite that dwelleth in vs, luſteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enuie?</p>
               <p>This place may be gathered out of diuerſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Scriptures. For it may be gathered out of <hi>Moiſes,</hi> his booke of Geneſis: where it is thus written, that God ſawe that the wickedneſſe of the earth, or man vpon the earth, was great, and the imaginations of his heart one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gene.</hi> 6.</note> euill continually. VVhere the Prophet teacheth that
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:19545:209"/> man naturally is wicked, and all his imaginations of heart, euil: therehence <hi>Iames</hi> might gather: that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally our ſpirite luſteth after enuie, after euill things, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the imaginations of mans heart are all euill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, It might bee gathered alſo out of that which after the deluge and floud, God ſaide in his heart, I will no more curſe the ground for mans ſake: for the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gene.</hi> 8.</note> of mans heart is euill, euen from his youth: this alſo intimateth that man naturally is giuen to corrupt luſts, and euill deſires, that therehence Saint <hi>James</hi> might ſay, Thinke you that the Scripture ſayth in vaine, the ſpirite that dwelleth in vs, luſteth after enuie? Or elſe it may bee gathered out of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> when hee ſayeth: The heart <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iere.</hi> 17.</note> is deceytfull aboue all things: who can knowe it? This in effect importeth thus much, that naturally wee luſt after enuie, and euill things. For hereby, and by other teſtimonies is auouched, that men not regenerate, are caryed naturally, with all force to euill. Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee anſwereth their obiection, though theſe luſtes bee naturall, yet ought they to bee ouyded: for the Scripture teacheth vs, that naturally we luſt after enuie, and deſire euill things. Thus the Scripture here ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that which out of the Scripture is gathered.</p>
               <p>Nowe hee ſayeth, that the Scripture ſayeth, that the ſpirite which dwelleth in vs, luſteth after enuie. By the Spirite, here the corrupt affection, and heart of man is vnderſtoode: the crooked, crabbed, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt diſpoſition of nature: the fancie, the inclination of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 13.</note> our hearts naturally. In which ſenſe and ſignification, the Prophet vſeth the worde Spirite: when God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to ſay to thoſe Prophets which prophecied out of their owne hearts; He are the worde of the Lorde: Thus ſayeth the Lorde GOD; Wo vnto the fooliſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that followe their owne ſpirite, and haue ſeene nothing. The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaking of King <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> ſayeth, that when his heart was puft vp, and his <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan</hi> 5.</note> Spirit hardened in pride: then was hee depoſed from his kingdome, and they tooke his honour from him. In
<pb facs="tcp:19545:210"/> which places and the like, the Spirite is taken for the heart, minde, and corrupt affection of man. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning then of this place is, that it is manifeſt by teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Scripture tending thereunto, that the heart, ſpirit, and minde of man, is naturally ſet vpon enuie, euill, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, neither dooth the Scriptures ſpeake in vaine thereof: for we are giuen in deede to luſt, to enuie, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to quarrell, to contende: either for encreaſe of wealth, or of honour among men. Therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſayeth not in vaine, for it is too ſure and certaine: that the ſpirite, which dwelleth in vs: naturall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which poſſeſſeth the ſeate of our hearts, luſteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enuie.</p>
               <p>Some by ſpirite here vnderſtande the Spirit of God, and reade the whole ſentence interrogatiuely thinke you that the Scripture ſayeth in vaine: the ſpirite that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in you, luſteth after enuie? Making this the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: dooth the Scripture teach, that Gods ſpirite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to enuie, debate, luſt, and ſuch like? No, it is not Gods Spirit that moueth men therunto: wherwith we are not guided when we are quarrellous and contentious. But how, thoſe words then, thinke you that the Scripture ſaith in vaine: may be vnderſtood, I ſee not. Therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the former ſence as môſt naturall.</p>
               <p>The other part of this anſwere, is: but the Scripture offereth more grace, and therefore ſaith: God reſiſteth the proude: but giueth grace to the humble. Whereas naturally wee are giuen to euill, and luſt after enuie: the Scripture offereth more grace, and giueth vs better counſell then to giue our ſelues to theſe quarrels, and to be caried away with ſuch deſires: therefore it ſayth, God reſiſteth the proude: but giueth grace to the humble.</p>
               <p>By the Scripture here, hee vnderſtandeth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent teſtimonies: for this thing, is in ſundrie places re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
               <p>By the proude, hee vnderſtandeth ſuch as in follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing their owne deſires and luſts, rebell agaynſt God. By the humble, he meaneth ſuch as in meekeneſſe of ſpirite
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:19545:210"/> and humilitie of minde, ſubmit themſelues to God with reuerence, and endeuour to ſuppreſſe their euill affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in themſelues: whoſe endeuour God fauoureth and furthereth: giuing his grace vnto them, which is farre better then all worldly riches, wealth, honour whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: or delights and pleaſures moſt precious among the ſonnes of men.</p>
               <p>This ſaying: God reſiſteth the proude, but giueth grace vnto the humble: eyther in the verie ſame woordes: or in woordes of the ſame ſenſe, is often repeated: and it conſiſteth of two members: 1 That God reſiſteth the proude. 2 That he giueth grace to the humble.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, God reſiſteth the proude: <hi>Dauid</hi> the princely Prophet auoucheth the ſame: God ſayth he wil <note place="margin">

See <hi>Cyprian.</hi> 1. lib. epiſt. 3. fol. 7.</p>
               <p>Now how, and by what meanes doth God reſiſt the <note place="margin">How God reſisteth the proude.</note> proud? by many meanes and ſundry.</p>
               <p n="1">1 He reſiſteth them by puniſhing them for their
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:19545:211"/> pride againſt him, as he did the builders of the Turret of Babel, whoſe toppe ſhould haue reached to heauen; if <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.</note> their purpoſe might haue bene effected. But God ſeeing the vanitie of their mindes, the pride of their hearts, and the inſolencie of their ſpirites, puniſhed them with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of their language, that one could not vnderſtand another, and ſo they were reſiſted. When <hi>Manaſſes</hi> was <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 33. <hi>Daniel</hi> 4.</note> puft vp with pride, he was reſiſted by the puniſhment of God, who deliuered him vp into captiuitie wherein he was humbled. <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> waxing proude of his goodly and gorgious citie which he had builte: was reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by God through puniſhmentes, for the Lord made him ſeuen yeares to remaine in the fieldes as a beaſt, and banniſhed him the ſocietie of man.</p>

Thus was the pryde of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> reſiſted, when God puniſhed him by little <hi>Dauid,</hi> who with his ſling ſtone patted him on the pate, caſt him <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings</hi> 17</note> to ground, and with his owne ſvvorde cut of his head, and ſo abated the pride and glory of the Philiſtines. Thus God reſiſteth the pride of <hi>Aſsur,</hi> by bringing many pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments vpon him, for his arrogancie and inſolencie of ſpirite.

Some are proude of their ſtrength: vvhich languiſhing ſicknes abateth. Some are proude of their powre: as <hi>Nabuchodonoſor, Senecherib, Antiochus, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey, Alexander,</hi> &amp; the like: whom God reſiſted, partly by taking away life: partly by remouing their power wherin they truſted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them.

               <p> Thus ſuch as do ambitiouſly ſeeke honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; by the iuſte iudgement of God loſe both their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices oftentimes, and alſo their eſtimation with men: and <note place="margin">

Thus the fall follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth their ambitious exaltation; confuſion, their vaine glorie; ignominie, their hautines and arrogancie; and ſo they are reſiſted.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Finally, God reſiſteth the proud, in deſtroying their remembrance, and cutting off their poſteritie from the earth, for their pride and wickednes. Thereof the holy <note place="margin">

               <p>When proud perſons, therefore, think to make their names immortall, and ſeeke to make their houſes and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations to continue for euer, and call their landes alſo <note place="margin">

By theſe, and the like waies the proud are reſiſted by God, and this place of the Apoſtle is found true; God reſiſteth the proud.</p>
               <p>Now as God reſiſteth the proud, ſo he geueth grace vnto the humble: which is the other member of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Apoſtle. Such as forſaking all worldly things, addict themſelues wholly vnto him, to ſerue and worſhip him in humilite: who caſt the crowne of their owne wit, riches, wealth, glorie, at the feete of God, and prefer him before all creatures: Theſe doeth God helpe; theſe hee furthereth; to them he geueth increaſe, and greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his grace; as to thoſe only, whom he looketh vnto:
<pb facs="tcp:19545:214"/> As by his Prophet <hi>Iſai</hi> he recordeth; To whom ſhoulde <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai</hi> 66.</note> I looke, but to him that is poore, and of an humble and contrite hart, and trembleth at my words. Theſe are they in whom he multiplieth his graces, and furthereth with his fauour, as our Apoſtle ſpeaketh: GOD reſiſteth the proud, but geueth grace to the humble. This ſong <hi>Anna</hi> the mother of <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſong in her pſalme of praiſe; The <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings</hi> 2.</note> Lord raiſeth vp the poore out of the dunghill, to ſet him among the Princes, and to make him inherite the ſeat of glorie.</p>
               <p>Whereunto holy <hi>Iob</hi> agreeth; The Lord ſetteth vp on high thoſe that are lowe: that the ſorowfull may be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.</note> In many of the former cited places, both me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers are in one ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce expreſſed: that as god reſiſteth the proud; ſo he geueth grace to the humble. Theſe he bleſſeth with plentifull benefits: to theſe he giueth a greater meaſure of his holy ſpirite; to theſe he ſheweth his louing fauour and mercie in ample manner; theſe he daily ladeth with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and greater bleſſings from his hand; theſe he mighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalteth of his fatherly goodnes; and thus ſheweth, or geueth he grace vnto the humble. Which thing <hi>Chylo</hi> the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Philoſopher (perchance) meant, who being asked <note place="margin">Chylo.</note> what god <hi>Iubiter</hi> did, anſwered; hee caſteth downe high things, and exalteth the things which are lowe.</p>
               <p>This thing is manifeſt in <hi>Moſes,</hi> who being of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirite, and walking lowly before the Lord, receaued grace many waies from God. <hi>Dauid</hi> being humble in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, was therefore taken from the flock of ſheepe, to rule the people of the Lord. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the mother of <hi>Iohn</hi> B. and <hi>Anna</hi> the mother of <hi>Samuel, Marie</hi> the virgin, &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt, ſeruing God in their humilitie, receaued
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19545:214"/> grace, and plentifull fauour from the hands of God. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the Lord encreaſeth his bleſſings; multiplieth his graces, enlargeth his promiſes, extendeth his fauourable countenance to thoſe, which ſetting aparte all worldlie things: cleaue immoueablie vnto him; according to this place of the Apoſtle; God reſiſteth the proud, but geueth grace to the humble.</p>
               <p>Almightie God therefore hath his two hands outſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: the one, wherewith as with a mallet, or hammer, he bruiſeth, and beateth downe the proud: the other, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he poureth out his plentifull graces vpon the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble: the one, wherewith he reſiſteth, and withſtandeth thoſe, who through loue of worldly things, rebell againſt him: the other, wherwith he fauorably entreteth, &amp; greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth ſuch, as renouncing worldly vanities, cleaue vnto him in humilitie of their mindes. Seing then this is true, let vs caſt downe our proud lookes, and hornes, which are ſet vp on high: and let vs with all humble reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce cleaue vnto the Lord, that he may increaſe his heauenly graces in vs: for he reſiſteth the proud, but giueth grace vnto the humble. And this I take to be the plaine meaning of the Apoſtle in theſe two verſes.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, if any be of an other opinion, I contend not: Euery one may abound in his owne ſence to edification. For ſome expound it, as I haue ſaide, thus; Thinke you that the Scripture ſaith in vaine; the Spirite that dwelleth in you, luſteth after enuie? doe you thinke that the Scripture teacheth, that wee are ſtirred vp to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie by Gods ſpirite? is his ſpirit a ſpirit of enuie, of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling, of contention? The ſpirite of God which dwelleth in you, and whereby you are ſealed vp to the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ</hi> 4</note> moueth you not thereunto: but rather the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sathan, which was a murtherer from the beginning; who is alſo that enuious man, which ſoweth ſedition, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.</note> contentions, braules and broiles, hartburning, and all miſchiefe, in the hearts of men. If you thinke thus, you <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.</note> are deceaued, for the Scripture offereth more grace: and therefore ſaith; God reſiſteth the proud, &amp;c. Whereby, as
<pb facs="tcp:19545:215"/> by a reaſon of contraries, he proueth that Gods ſpirite is not cauſe of contentions, which come of pride: becauſe he reſiſteth the proud and contentious, and geueth grace to the humble.</p>
               <p>Some others expound it in this wiſe; Think you that the Scripture ſaith in vaine, The ſpirite that dwelleth in you luſteth after enuie? Thinke you that the Scripture ſaith in vaine, That Gods ſpirite in you is iealous; that it enuyeth that you ſhould loue any other; that you ſhould geue your ſelues to the loue of the world? Nay, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith not that in vaine: For the Spirite of God is a ielous Spirite, and taketh in euill parte, that you ſhoulde forſake him, to loue the world: he enuieth, that any part of your loue ſhould be deriued from him, to creatures: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-you are commanded to loue him, with all your harts, ſtrength, power, might, and all that is in you.</p>
               <p>And if you ſay, it is hard not at all to deſire worldlie things, and cleaue wholly to God; I denie it not: yet God geueth more grace vnto you, whereby you ſhalbe able to doe this. They which thus expound it, (as many doe,) leaue out this whole ſentence; God reſiſteth the proude, and geueth grace to the humble. Theſe being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon expoſitions, and fathered vpon the beſt Authours: thereof, that which moſt agreeth with the circumſtance of the place, (as me thinketh the firſt doeth) let it runne for the moſt currante.

For what doth God better accept of, then of our holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto him? this is more acceptable to God, then ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, this is more pleaſant then the fatte of rammes. This <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings</hi> 15.</note> duetie men are neceſſarilie to perfourme vnto God, and vnto his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt; to whom they are betrothed, as to an husband.</p>
               <p>God witneſſeth by <hi>Oſe</hi> his Prophet, that he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Saints vnto himſelfe, in the words which he vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto his choſen people; I haue maried thee vnto my <note place="margin">

The Church is eſpouſed vnto Ieſus Chriſt: therfore ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; I haue prepared you for one husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, to preſent you as a pure virgin vnto Chriſt. Therefore, as the Spouſe and maried wife, oweth her ſubiection, ſubmiſſion, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto him, whoſe wife ſhe is; and in all honeſtie,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19545:216"/> duetifulneſſe ought to applie her ſelfe to the will of her husbande: euen ſo ought the Church and Saintes of God in all duetifull obedience to ſubmit themſelues to God, and his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt. For this cauſe Saint <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> inſtituteth and maketh a large compariſon betwixt the wife and the Church: Chriſt, and the husbande: that by the mutuall collation of the Church, and the maried wife: and the anologicall proportion betwixt them: both the wife might learne obedience to her husband, and the Church and Saints, their ſubiection to God. Whoſe onely worde, muſt be the rule of our whole life: whoſe will in al things we muſt obey. To whoſe commandement we muſt be applyable: which is our reuerende ſubmiſſion vnto God.</p>
               <p>Laying therefore aſide all enuie, malice, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wrath, indignation, fighting, quarrelling: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto wee are mooued by the contentious ſpirite of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: wee muſt in all humilitie of our mindes ſubmit our ſelues vnto God, as the Apoſtle exhorteth: Submit your ſelues to God.</p>
               <p>Men ſubmit themſelues vnto God, diuerſe wayes. 1 In <note place="margin">
                     <hi>How are men ſubiect to God.</hi> 1</note> obediently and reuerently yeelding themſelues to his worde and will, in hearing what he commaundeth: and carefully perfourming, what hee inioyneth. For as the ſonne is ſubiect to his father: and the ſeruant ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe to his maiſter, then when the ſonne hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and obeyeth the will of his father, and the ſeruant of his maiſter: euen ſo the Saints of God are ſubiect to God, and ſubmit themſelues to him, when they obey the will and comaundement of God: which thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, wee ſubmit not our ſelues to him, but rebell againſt him.

All the Prophets, our Sauiour Chriſt: <hi>Steuen</hi> the martyr: the bleſſed Apoſtles, haue condemned the Iſraelites and Iewes as a rebellious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in that they woulde not obey his worde: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in chiefly ſhewe their ſubmiſſion.

               <p>If then our ſubmiſſion to God ſhewe it ſelfe in the obedience to his will and worde: then neither idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, neither curſed couetous perſons, neither filthie fornicatours, neither peſtilent vſurers, neither blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous ſwearers, neither bitter backebiters, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cruell extorcioners, neither violent oppreſſours, neither proude Peacockes, neither bloudie murtherers, neither ſhamefull lyers, neither beaſtly drunkards, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deceitfull dealers: neither any ſuch like, of the rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blement and route of the wicked, ſubmit themſelues to God: but rather therein rebell againſt him.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As by obeying his will, men ſubmit themſelues vnto God: ſo by yeelding themſelues to Gods pleaſure to doe with them after his will: men ſubmit themſelues vnto him.

               <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt was ſubiect, and ſubmitted him ſelfe to God: when he yeelded himſelfe applyable to the <note place="margin">

So when in all our temporall eſtate, for honour, orignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie on earth: when for health, or ſickeneſſe: when for children, or for other things whatſoeuer, wee yeelde our ſelues wholy and obediently vnto God: when we free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and voluntarily abide his pleaſure therein: when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grudging or groyning: muttering or murmuring: <note place="margin">

               <p n="3">3 Neyther thus onely ſubmit men themſelues vn-God, but alſo when they beare with pacience the croſſe which the Lorde layeth vpon them, then ſubmitte men themſelues to God.

               <p> 2 The next thing in this firſt part of duetie is the contrarie: wee muſt ſubmit our ſelues to God: but we muſt reſiſt the diuell: which thing the holy Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in like manner commendeth vnto vs: bee ſober <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.</note> and watch: for your aduerſarie the diuell like a roaring lion, goeth about, ſeeking whome hee may deuoure: whom reſiſt ſteadfaſt in the fayth.

               <p n="3">3 The precept, and the contrarie being thus ſette downe, the thirde thing in this former part of duetie, is the reaſon of the contrarie: why wee ſhoulde oppoſe our ſelues vnto Sathan, and ſet our ſelues to reſiſt him. Which reaſon is drawen from hope of victorie: if we thus, and by al meanes reſiſt him, then he flieth from vs; then is he put to flight, repelled, and put back. Reſiſt the deuill, and hee will flie from you: that they may put Sathan to flight, and triumph victoriouſlie ouer him, men ought by all meanes to reſiſt him.</p>
               <p>Sathan, the deuill, is of a daſtardlie and cowardlie nature; fierce and furious againſt the fearefull: but flieth away from ſuch as withſtand and reſiſt him. Saint <hi>Barnard</hi>

Wherefore he may very worthely be compared and reſembled to the Crocodile: who (as it is <note place="margin">Crocodile.</note> affirmed) flieth away when a man turneth boldely vnto him: but followeth very fiercely, when he is not reſiſted. So Sathan, that olde dragon, that cruell crocodile, flieth when he is reſiſted: but followeth vs hardly when we geue place vnto him.

               <p>To enlarge this circumſtance a little, we may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that as God by many wayes draweth neare vnto vs: ſo we by no leſſe draw neare vnto him.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Men draw neare to God by outward profeſſion, though it be not alwayes in ſinceritie of heart: thus did the people of Iſrael in outwarde profeſſion, and with their mouthes drawe neare to God, which as a token <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29. 58. 2. 3.</note> of hypocriſie is condemned. God therefore ſpeaking

Thus inueyed hee againſt ſuch as in mouth profeſſed God, but denyed him in heart, which hee meaneth by reynes. This is that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryſie worthily condemned by <hi>Paul:</hi> in wordes they <note place="margin">

Thus men in the outward profeſſion of the Goſpell, though ſometimes it bee in hypocriſie, are ſaid to draw neare to God: as now moſt men doe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Men alſo drawe neare to God by fayth in Ieſus Chriſt, whereby they haue enteraunce vnto God. Of which kinde the holy Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iuſtified by faith, wee haue peace with God, through <note place="margin">

In another place, the ſame authour ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this drawing neare to God, writeth and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in this wiſe: Seeing we haue an high Prieſt which is ouer the houſe of God, let vs drawe neare with a true heart, in aſſuraunce of faith, ſptinckled in our hearts from an euill conſcience, and waſhed in our bodies with pure water. Let vs (ſayeth he) draw neare with a true heart in aſſurance of faith.</p>
               <p>Finally, ſhewing the verie high way which leadeth vnto God, and whereby wee draw neare and come vnto him, hee maketh that to bee faith: whereby the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue approched and drawne neare vnto him: whereof hee thus concludeth: withour fayth, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God. For hee which commeth to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</note> God, muſt beleeue that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that ſeeke him. VVherefore as through infidelitie we were eſtraunged from God: ſo by faith are wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled vnto him, and knit into a miſticall coniunction with God, whereby we drawe neare vnto him. To truſt therefore perfectly in the grace of God by Ieſus Chriſt: aſſuredly to beleeue the promiſes of God, made vnto vs in his beloued: to repoſe all our hope of happineſſe vpon God, through the mediation and merits of Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: to looke for eternall ſaluation from God by fayth, in the onely paſſion of our bleſſed Sauiour, and ſo in our conſciences to haue peace with God, and bee reconciled vnto him: is another and ſecond way, whereby we drawe neare vnto God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Men drawe neare to God alſo by prayer, wherby we aſcend, as it were to heauen, and approch neare to the preſence of God, which is, as it were, a paire of wings to carie vs to him: whereby, as by a key, ſaith Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi>

Thus the Prophet <hi>Moiſes</hi> in the departing out of Aegypt, and in the encountering in battle with the Amalakites, drew neare to God. Thus <hi>Ioſua</hi> drew neare to him, when <note place="margin">

Thus <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Silas</hi> drew neare to god, when at their praier ihe very foundations of the earth ſhooke and trembled. Thus the praiers of gods Saints ſhake heauen and earth, and make away for vs, wherby we draw neare vnto God. Thus flie we to God in our needes: thus drawe we neare vnto him: thus are we ioined vnto god, to whom we draw neare by praier, which leadeth vs to the preſence of god, and of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Neither do men draw neare to god by praier only, <note place="margin">

Thereof thus ſaith the Lord by his prophet: turne againe vnto me, and I will turne vnto you ſaith the lord of hoſts.

               <p>This ſorrowing, and heauines of our heartes, is that contrite ſpirite, that humbled and broken heart, which <note place="margin">

               <p>This is that inward grife of the Saints which in their hearts they conceiue for their ſinnes committed agaynſt God, and thereby ſhewe their afflicting and chaſtiſing of themſelues before him.

The proud conceite of his owne righteouſneſſe, which the proud Phariſie had conceaued, made him to contemne the poore Publican, and to ſpeak euill of him, euen to the face, and in the preſence of God, in the Temple; I thanke thee (O God) that I am not as other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; extortioners, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, adulterers, or euen as this Publicane. The proud and wicked men of the world, ſeeing that the Saintes woulde not runne the ſame exceſſe of riot with them, and liue as pleaſed them: therefore ſaith Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> they ſpeake euil <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4</note> of them.</p>
               <p>Our Apoſtle here making pride the cauſe of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and inſinuating, that the proud and arrogant perſons of the world, will proudely condemne, and ſlanderouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeake of all thoſe, who liue not after their pleaſures: condemneth it as the effect of pride: neither is there, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, any thing that more moueth men to ſpeak euil one of another, then pride doeth: So that the proud perſon hardly euer ſpeaketh well of any, but that he only may be in eſtimation, account, and credite, he ſpeaketh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of al others.</p>
               <p>Theſe and the like cauſes may be alleadged of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, and miſchiefe, which S. <hi>Iames</hi> worthely condemneth; Speake not euill one of another, brethren. <note place="margin">How men ſpeak euil.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This miſchiefe is manifolde: and ſundrie waies are men ſaide to ſpeake euill one of another.</p>
               <p n="1">1 When men miſreport of vs, and charge vs with that which is not true, then ſpeake they euil of vs. In this kinde was <hi>Dauid</hi> euil ſpoaken of, as in the Pſalme he witneſſeth; Cruell witneſſes roſe vp againſt me; they asked me things <note place="margin">

               <pb facs="tcp:19545:247"/>
               <p> Thus <hi>Doeg</hi> the Edomite, (the chiefe of <hi>Sauls</hi> Heard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) ſpoke euill of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Achimelech</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Nob,</hi> affirming that they tooke councell together againſt <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings</hi> 22.</note> the king: I ſaw the ſonne of <hi>Iſhai,</hi> when he came to <hi>Nob,</hi> to <hi>Achimelech,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ahitub,</hi> who asked councell of the Lord for him. Such euill ſpeaches were they, of thoſe flattering Paraſites, and backbiting Sicophants, who falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie infourmed <hi>Saul,</hi> that <hi>Dauid</hi> intended miſchiefe againſt him. In this kinde proud <hi>Hamon</hi> ſpoke euill againſt <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docheus,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings</hi> 24 <hi>Heſter</hi> 3</note> and the people of the Iewes, who charged them with thinges vntrue, in bringing vp euill and falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of them: There is a people (ſaith he) ſcattered and diſperſed among the people, in all the Prouinces of thy kingdome: whoſe lawes are diuers to all lawes, &amp; obſerue not the lawes of the king. In the ſeruice (indeede) of their God, they obeyed not; but in ciuill things, they were obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient vnto the lawes of <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> and therfore were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged falſly with diſloyaltie, &amp; rebellion againſt the lawes of the king.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſpeake euill one of another, when to defame and diſcredite one another, we forge, we faine, we frame and deuiſe falſe things againſt our brethren, to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into hatred, that we only might be accounted of.</p>
               <p>Wherein wee play the partes of malicious perſons, who bedaube and bedaſhe with dirte, the faces of other folke, that we might ſeeme the fairer: and ſoyle, ſlurrie, &amp; file the garmentes of our neighboures, that ours might ſeeme the gayer and gallanter. Thus by falſe reports, and ſlaunderous ſpeeches: thus by reproachfull contumelie, and backbiting, men defile the name, fame, and credit of men, and impeach their eſtimation, that themſelues may appeare and ſeeme the wiſer, iuſter, honeſter, &amp; worthier in all things. And thus by reporting falſe thinges of our brethren, to diſcredite them, we ſpeake euill of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Neither thus onely ſpeake men euill one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but alſo when they amplifie, exaggerate, aggrauate, and make the infirmities and faults of men farre greater, by their reports, then indeede they be, to make them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:19545:247"/> in the ſight of men: as when our neighbour is ſomething choloricke and haſtie; to report him to bee ſo madde, furious, and headſtrong, that none can abide it. If a man onely ſalute a woman by the way, to ſay, hee talked with her of adulterie. If our btother ſmite in anger, to ſay, he would haue ſlaine and murthered. When by our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, we make the infirmities of men greater, and farre more hainous then they be indeede: this is euill ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and worthely to be condemned. And it is vſuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men now, to diſcredite, and make other folke odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the ſight and hearing of others, to amplifie their faultes, and make them farre greater then they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede: this is alſo ſlaunder, this is euill ſpeach againſt our neighbour. Thus doe eloquent Sycophants: thus doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoricall ſlaunderers: thus doe backebiting whiſperers: thus doe falſe accuſers of their neighbours, who make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing worſe then it is in deede: and by reporting, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their crimes: this ought alſo to be auoyded of the Saints of God, who ought not (ſo much as in this wiſe) to ſpeake euill of their brethren.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Beſides this, men ſpeake euill of their breathren, when they blaſe abroade the ſecrete ſinnes and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their brethren, when they ſhoulde haue couered them in loue, onely to diſcredite, and defame the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <hi>Salomon</hi> making the detecting and reuealing of the <note place="margin">

In this manner, men ſinne when of the good deedes of men they ſay, they were done to euil end, vpon euill intent, by vnlawfull meanes, not in ſinceritie, and loue to vertue, but in colourable manner, and in fraudulent and deceitfull hypocriſie.</p>

               <p>VVherefore let mee exhort all ſuch in the feare of God: to examine their owne affections, to enter into the cloſet of their owne thoughts, to caſt downe their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and peremptorie iudgements: to leaue the ſtealing away of the hearts of the people from their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Paſtours, by miſlyking of their lawfull and tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable doings: and let me in the bowels of Ieſus Chriſt beſeech them, and by the mercies of God entreate them: that when things are not to their mindes: yea, if there be blemiſhes, ſpottes and wrinckles in the face of the Church, (as there ſhal be to the ende): that with paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they woulde beare them, as becommeth Saintes: with prayer they would ſeeke to redreſſe them: that they ſpeake not euill againſt ſuch as in opinions varie from them: that they powre not out the poyſon, venome and rancour of their hearts, by condemning their brethren: that they teare not in ſunder, the vnſeamed coate of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt by their bitter contending, vvith backbiting and diſcrediting of their fellowe labourers, and worke fellowes in the Lordes harueſt: but that they take ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular heede, and haue ſpeciall care to abandon and aboliſh this miſchiefe of pride, and to holde faſt this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation of the Apoſtle: Speake not euil one of another brethren.</p>

Thus when we ſpeake euill of our brethren and condemne them, becauſe they walke not after our willes, neither liue according to our pleaſures: we are not onely iniurious to our brethren,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:250"/> but we are iniurious to the law of God, wherof we ſpeake euill, and which wee condemne in ſpeaking euill, and condemning our brethren: to ſpeake euill of the law, and to condemne it, is a great ſinne, and great euil. Therefore, muſt wee not ſpeake euill or condemne our brethren: becauſe thereby the lawe is euill ſpoken of, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by vs.</p>
               <p>How doth the law ſuſtaine iniurie, in thus iniury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">How ſpeake we euil of the lawe, when we ſpeake euil of the brethren.</note> of our brethren? howe is it violated, howe is it euill ſpoken of, and condemned, when our brethren are euill ſpoken of and condemned by vs?</p>
               <p>Gods lawe teacheth vs not to condemne, not to ſpeake euil of the brethren. When notwithſtanding this lawe, we doe and will ſpeake euill and condemne our brethren: then wee ſpeake euill of the lawe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it in effect: becauſe wee will not bee brideled thereby: when wee will not bee reſtrayned from proude and arrogant condemning, nor withhelde from ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king euill of our brethren by this lawe of God.

Thus in effect we ſpeake euill of the lawe, and condemne it as vnſufficient, vnperfect, vnworthie to teach vs: thus in our actions, and by our deedes we ſpeake euill of the law, and condemne it, as not wiſe inough, as not good i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, as not circumſpect inough: thus wee finde fault with the law, as if it did not wel in forbidding vs to ſpeake euill one of another: and thus in the actions and practiſe of our liues, we ſpeake euill of the lawe, and condemne it,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19545:250"/> when wee ſpeake euill of our brethren, and condemne them, which thing the law forbiddeth.</p>
               <p>Wherein it fareth with the lawe of God, as it often fareth vvith the poſitiue lavves of Princes.

This the Apoſtle confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:251"/> draweth his argument from the breach of Gods lawe, and the iniurie thereunto done, when we ſpeake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of the brethren, and diſſuadeth vs there from, by this argument; in ſpeaking euil of the brethren and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, we ſpeake euill of the lawe and condemne it; therefore muſt we not ſpeake euill of the brethren; for he that ſpeaketh euill of his brother, and he that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his brother, ſpeaketh euill of the lawe and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the lawe. Which reaſon of the Apoſtle holdeth not onely in this perticular, whereunto it is applied, but it is generally true in the whole lawe of God, and euery parte and member thereof, that when we breake it, eyther in whole, or in parte, thereby we ſpeake euill and condemne it, eyther in whole or in parte likewiſe. 1. When the law therefore ſaith: Thou ſhalt haue no other God but one; notwithſtanding, to make many Gods, as the idols of the Heathen: the workes of our owne hands, the righteouſnes which our ſelues haue wrought: the Saints in heauen, as many we do: to make our gold our God, as the couetous; to make our bellies our Gods, as the Epicures: to make our backes our Gods, as prowde perſons doe; this is to ſpeake euill of the lawe and condemne it. 2. When the lawe ſaith: Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen image, of any likenes whatſoeuer to worſhip it: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to make the image of the father, ſonne, or holy ghoſt, to expreſſe the diuine maieſtie, &amp; thereby to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God; to make the image of <hi>Marie, Peter, John, Iames, Paul,</hi> or any other man or woman, &amp; in our temples to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, &amp; do worſhip vnto them, is to ſpeak euill of the law &amp; to condemne it. 3. When the law ſaith: Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, to name God vnreuerently; to profeſſe him cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfetly; to cal vpon him deceitfully, to ſweare by him falſly, or vainely, is to ſpeake euill of the lawe and to condemne it. 4. When the law ſaith: Remember to keepe holy the Saboth day; yet not regarding that law, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane the Lordes day, in banquetting, in ſurfetting: in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, in dauncing, in enterluding, in play following, in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:19545:251"/> bearbaiting, &amp; bulbaiting, in going &amp; gadding abroad, in ſleeping, in idleneſſe, in other lewdeneſſe or looſenes whatſoeuer: what is this but to ſpeake euill of the lawe and condemne it? 5. When the lawe ſaith: Honour thy father and mother; notwithſtanding this, to denie dutie to our parents, in not reuerencing them as beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vs: is not relieuing them in extreame age &amp; pouertie: to be diſobedient to the fathers of our countries, princes and magiſtrates: to neglect our ſpirituall fathers, our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and paſtours, which begitte vs daily through the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.</note> of the goſpell: not to giue duetifull ſeruice to ſuch as are our maiſters after the fleſhe, and for the time in ſteede of our parents: not to performe that reuerence to all our elders and betters, as by due belongeth vnto them: is to ſpeake euill of the lawe, and to condemne it. 6. When the law ſaith: Thou ſhalt not kill; yet ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heart by hatred, or in tongue by ſlaunder, or in hande by violence to murther eyther our ſelues or others; is it not to ſpeake euill of the lawe, and condemne it? 7. When the lawe ſaith: Thou ſhalt not commit adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: yet to hunte after ſtraunge fleſh, in thy heart to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire any other beſides thy married and lawfull wife, in ſight, in ſhewe, in ſigne to pretende carnall looſeneſſe; to ioyne thy ſelfe vnlawfully by fleſhly coniunction to any other, then thy yoke fellow appointed by God: is to ſpeake euill of the lawe, and condemne it. 8. When the lavve ſaith: Thou ſhalt not ſteale; yet, to robbe, to ſpoile, by ſea, by lande, to oppreſſe by violence, to retayne by force the goods of our brethren, to deceyue by fraude the ſimple of his right: to picke, to ſteale, to pilfer, or by any ſiniſter way, to poſſeſſe that is not thine owne: what is this but the ſpeaking euill of the lawe, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning thereof? 9. When the lawe ſaith: Thou ſhalte not beare falſe witneſſe againſt thy neighbour, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to teſtifie and witneſſe a falſe matter, to lie and ſpeake vntruly of, and to our brethren; to vſe diſceit or forged cauillation in our tongues, to counterfet, to diſlemble, to gloſe with our lippes, or any like way, here
<pb facs="tcp:19545:252"/> againſt to offend, is to ſpeake euill of the lawe, and to condemne it. 10. When the lawe ſaith: Thou ſhall not couet; though we abſtaine from the outward action, and doing of euill; yet burne inwardly in vnlawfull luſt of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which is not ours; what is this, but to ſpeake euill of the lawe, and to condemne it? Finally, whatſoeuer the law enioyneth, therein not to be obedient; what is it but in effect, to ſpeake euill of the law, and condemne it? Which we then ſpeake euil of, and condemne, when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto we will not be obedient. Thus then the lawe of God violently broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wilfully withſtood, voluntarily reſiſted of men, is euil ſpoken of &amp; condemned for that they ſhew in effect, that they miſlike it; as not worthy to direct &amp; leade them in the race of their liues; and this is the firſt reaſon why we may not ſpeake euil of our brethren, nor conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne them raſhly, becauſe thereby we ſpeake euill of the lawe, and condemne it, which teacheth vs not to ſpeake euill of, or condemne our brethren.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon, why we ſhould not ſpeake euill of, <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> or condemne the brethren, is drawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the duetie of the ſaints; it is the dutie of Gods children, to do the lawe, not to iudge or condemne it. The law ſaith, ſpeake not euil of thy brother, neither condemne thy brother; this law muſt <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.</note> we do, and endeuour to fulfill it in euery point, &amp; not by withſtanding it, ſeeme to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne it, and be iudges of it. Men condemne the law, when they condemne their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: they iudge the lawe, when they will not be taught thereby, nor reformed; but as iudging it vnworthy to be the rule and line of their life, they withſtand it. God hath not appointed vs to iudge his lawe, but rather to doe it, therfore by not ſpeaking euil of the brethren, muſt we do the law, and not by reſiſting it, condemne and iudge it.</p>
               <p>How men are ſaide to do the law, See. S. <hi>Iames ch.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 22. The meaning of this place is, that we are ordained to be doers of the lavv, and by God vvilled to labour to fulfill it; therfore it ſtandeth vs vpon thereunto to tende: therein to labour and trauell: and not by arrogantly iudging of our brethren, raſhly to iudge of the law.</p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:19545:252"/>
               <p> Men become the iudges of the law, when by obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately tranſgreſſing of the law, they ſeeme ſuperiours and aboue the law, as ſuch as will not be ſubiect therunto: and not, by doing it, ſeeme inferiours, as they which will be ruled thereby: then, when we ſpeake euill of our brethren, which the law forbiddeth, in riſing vp &amp; reſiſting againſt this law, we ſeeme to be aboue the law, as ſuch as will not be reſtrained thereby. To iudge the law, &amp; not to do it, is great ſinne. Therfore muſt we rather in not ſpeaking euill <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.</note> of the law, do it, then in ſpeaking euill thereof, iudge it. Great bleſſings are promiſed ſuch as do obſerue the law, a great curſe likewiſe is threatened to them which do not keepe it: <hi>Moſes</hi> therefore ſaith, Curſed is euery one that continueth not in all the wordes of this law to do them.

When vve ſpeake not euill of our brethren, vvee fulfill the royall lavve: vvhich ſaith, Loue thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelfe: vvhen vvee ſpeake euill of them and iudge them, becauſe they vvalke not according to our pleaſures, vve iudge the lavve, vvhich is farre from our dutie.</p>
               <p>The lavv is by God ordained to be the line and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell of our life: the guyde of our feete, the gouernour of our pathes: therefore the princely Prophete <hi>Dauid</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

And this is the ſecond reaſon of the Apoſtle, why we may not ſpeake euill of the brethren: becauſe in ſo doing we are not doers of the law which dutie requireth, but iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which becommeth not the ſaints.</p>

               <p>In the whole courſe of the lawe and Prophets, it is witneſſed, that the lawes of life and death, which preſſe the hearts and conſciences of men, are only the Lordes: and that he onely according thereunto iudgeth: ſo that men may not take vpon them to drawe all others after their tailes, and leade them at their pleaſures: which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they refuſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo to ſpeake euil of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.</note> which gaue this law vnto his own people Iſrael: the Lord ſhewed his word to <hi>Jacob,</hi> his ſtatutes and his ordinances to Iſrael: he eſtabliſhed a lawe in <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ordeyned a
<pb facs="tcp:19545:254"/> teſtimonie in Iſraell: which he commaunded our fathers to teach their children: ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi> the holie Prophet. And this concerning the moral preceptes thereof, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting, vniuerſall, and to all the world giuen. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is to be reputed the law giuer and the iudge only which gaue it firſt vnto Iſrael his people.</p>
               <p>Who being the onlie geuer of the lawe, can thereby either ſaue or deſtroye: condemne, or iuſtifie, pardon or puniſh: wherefore this muſt men leaue to him alone, which if they do not, but wil condemne their brethren after their wills, then challenge they to themſelues the right of God: then thruſt they him from his heauenly throne of iudgement: therin endeuour they, as it were to riſe vp in his rome, and giue that ſentence, which only belongeth vnto him: then which arrogancie and pride, what can be greater?</p>
               <p>It is the Lord that ſearcheth the hearts and raines: it is he, who perceth into the cogitations of men, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they are but vaine: he knoweth only who are his, and he alone can tel when and whom to ſaue or conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to diſcharge or deſtroye: this prorogatiue we take from God, of this priuiledge we ſpoile him, of this preferment of iudging and condemning, of making and ſetting lawes of life and death to the conſciences of men, we then bereue God: when we in the pride of our hearts ſpeake euil and condemne our brethren, vvhen they diſpleaſe vs and our humours. Thus men challenge to themſelues that vvhich is Gods and Chriſts only: thus take they ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of iudgement out of the mouth of God: and take the povver of geuing lavves to the Church, out of his hands: hovv great is this blaſphemous preſumption, hovv hainous is this extreame vngodlynes?</p>
               <p>For as it is not only doting and foule follie, but horrible impietie, and vvickednes in the higheſt degree, for men to take vppon them to repele the eternall lavves of God, geuen by him to the Church and all poſteritie for euermore: So is it likewiſe no leſſe vngratiouſneſſe, an louer bolde and preſumptious raſhnes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:19545:254"/> lawes contrarie to his, as if we would teach him wiſdome: and thereby to iudge our brethren.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is our king, hee onely is the head ouer his Church, therefore, as vnto the king, and chiefe head of his Church, it belongeth of right to geue lawes to the ſaints. Was it euer heard among earthly Princes, that loyall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects either could, or would, either repell, or change the lawes of their Princes? or doe they at any time take vpon them to make lawes of their owne heads, without their Princes, in their owne kingdomes? or can there be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter treaſon and rebellion, then to endeuour to ſeeke ſuch lewde libertie? doe the Princes and Peeres of Common-weales, call Parlements, ſet downe lawes, without the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of their Kinges and Emperours? were not this great conſpiracie? and ſhall men take vpon them in the church, which is the royal ſeat of Chriſt, and the very ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his kingdom, to eſtabliſh lawes without his licence? were there euer lawes proclaimed in any kingdom, but in the name of that king which there raigneth? &amp; ſhall men proclaim lawes of their own deuiſing, in chriſts kingdom, vnder any other name, or authoritie, then by the name &amp; authoritie of Ieſus Chriſt? wherefore, we deny Chriſts ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraintie ouer vs, when without him we will make lawes to others: and we refuſe God to be our law geuer, when beſides his lawes, we will proclaime lawes to binde our brethren. Which thing, as groſſe ſollie, and great impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the Apoſtle condemneth: teſtifying, that God only is our law-geuer, and iudge; in whoſe power it is to ſaue and deſtroy: and therefore men ought not to challenge that to themſelues, in any wiſe.</p>
               <p>Of this euill how many are now giltie? is not euery one readie to preſcribe lawes of the liues of their brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſiſters? If we ſee any, either in the habite of apparrell, or in the talke of the tongue, or in the geſture of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, either in the courſe of his Common life, or in the religion, and worſhippe he perfourmed to God, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, which walketh not according to our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and agreeth not in all things to our life and ruie:
<pb facs="tcp:19545:255"/> how ſoone ſpeake we euill of him? how proudly doe wee iudge him? how peremptorilie doe wee condemne him? Thus one man dealeth with another: one woman thus iudgeth another: thus the people condemne the paſtors; the paſtors the people: thus the Cleargie ſpeake euill of the Temporaltie; and they of the Cleargie: thus one prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of another; one laie man of another: and almoſt eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of his neighbour.</p>
               <p>Is not this to vſurpe that which belongeth vnto god? is not this to take the ſcepter of iudgement out of the hande of Ieſus Chriſt? This is reprooued by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who art thou that condemneſt another mans ſeruant? he ſtandeth, or falleth, to his owne maſter: what haſt thou to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.</note> intermeddle where thou haſt not to doe? This is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by this Apoſtle: who aſcribeth preſcription of lawes, and pronouncing of iudgement, to God onely: who can ſaue, and deſtroy; but thou (ô man) canſt ſaue none: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by thy proud iudgement, condemne and deſtroye none: yet condemneſt and deſtroyeſt (as much as in thee lieth) thy brother: when, becauſe hee liueth not after thy pleaſure, thou ſpeakeſt euill of him. And this is the third argument of the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>The fourth, and laſt reaſon, why we ſhould not ſpeake <note place="margin">The fourth reaſon.</note> euill, or raſhly condemne our brethren, is, from the frailty of our owne common ſtate and condition: For all men are ſubiect to infirmities, therefore ought we not, one of vs raſhly to condemne another. And this reaſon, that it might be more forcible, it is propoſed in the manner of an interrogation; Who art thou, which iudgeſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? art not thou a man ſubiect to like infirmities? why doeſt thou ſo proudly then iudge thy brother? who art thou that iudgeſt another man? whence art thou? who did geue thee that authoritie? who hath beautified thee with this prerogatiue, &amp; preferment, aboue thy brethren? who hath lifted thee vp to ſo great glorie, as to geue ſentence of iudgement of thy brother?</p>
               <p>By which ſpeach, men are not onely admoniſhed of their infirmities; Who art thou? art thou ſingular &amp; alone,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:19545:255"/> in whom there is no imperfection? Art thou exempted from the common condition of all men, in whoſe life there is neither ſpotte nor wrinckle, nor any blemiſhe of ſinne? but alſo tolde and taught their vnworthineſſe, how farre they are from that preferment and preheminence, to iudge of their brethren; Who art thou, that iudgeſt an other man? ſo that by a iuſt deriſon, and a bitter taunt, the Apoſtle ſheweth both their infirmitie of condition, &amp; vnworthines to ſo great a thing, which take vpon them to iudge their brethren.</p>
               <p>Wherein he rightly alludeth to the common ſpeach of men; who ſeeing a proud perſon, taking too much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and arrogating great matters vnto himſelfe, to teach him his groſſe follie, and to tell him of his vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, ſay in this wiſe vnto him; Alas good Sir, who are you? what, are you better then your fellowes? is there none ſo good as you? So the Apoſtle, to beate down their pride, by the conſideration of naturall infirmitie: and to abate their loftie ſtomaches, through view of their owne vnworthines, to bee in that place ouer their brethren, which they proudely challenge, and take to themſelues, breaketh out, and ſaith; Who art thou, that iudgeſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man?</p>
               <p>There is no better bridle to the headie, and haſtie iudging of other men, then to be pluckt backe with the raines and bitte of our owne frailtie, and view of our own infirmities: which thing greatly abateth our pride, aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth our hatred, cooleth our courage, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the haſtines of our iudgements againſt our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>When the Peacocke beholdeth his taile, beſet with ſuch varietie of beautifull colours: then hee ſwelleth in pride, contemning, and condemning all other birdes in compariſon of himſelfe: but when he looketh vppon his blacke feete, and veweth the deformitie thereof, his comb is ſomething cutte, and his courage abated: So when wee lifte vp our eyes to the graces and giftes of God beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vpon vs: then we waxe proud and inſolent: but when
<pb facs="tcp:19545:256"/> wee caſte our eyes downe vpon the manifolde infirmities whereunto we are ſubiect: then is our pride abated, &amp; our inſolency of ſpirite diminiſhed, and we made more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and temperate, in iudging of our chriſtian brethren.

Say not all men and women almoſt in the confidence of their owne ſtates; this will wee doe; and that will wee doe: not looking to the will and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uidence
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:19545:258"/> of God, but determine their matters long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the vanitie and pride of their owne mindes? This is the vaine confidence which men conceyue of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, reprooued by the Apoſtle, Go to nowe, you that ſay, to day or to morrow will we go into ſuch a Citie: and there continue a yeare: and by and ſell, and occupie and gaine.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This ſpeach and vaine conſidence the Apoſtle <note place="margin">The reaſons condemning this pride.</note> condemneth by a double reaſon. 1 From the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainetie of euents which times alter: who knoweth what to morrowe may bring? The time to come is vncertaine, to morrow may haue euents which we knowe not, nor dreame of: to morrowe may bring things to paſſe quite contrarie to our purpoſes, which, may altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alter theſe determinations: wee can not aſſure our ſelues of like euents to morrowe, as wee ſee to day: who knoweth whether to morrowe will bring life or death, pouertie, or aduerſitie: ſickeneſſe or health: good or euill? Therefore ought wee not to preſume of the time to come. One night altereth many things. Manie men are aliue ouer night, deade in the morning. Manie are ouer night rich and wealthie: by next day, impoueriſhed and beggered altogether. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie houſes ſtand to day, which before to morrowe may vtterly be deſtroyed and burnt to the ground. Manie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions are now drie land, which by to morrowe may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-flowne, and ouer whelmed with ſudden ruſhing in of the ſea and waters. Manie at libertie to day, which ere to morrow may be reſtrained.</p>
               <p>Theſe euents are vncertaine, neyther knovve wee vvhat to morrovv vvill bring vnto vs: vvhat va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie then is it to determine of things long before, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that one night may ſo eaſily alter all, and turne things vp ſide dovvne?

Let vs heare therefore the graue counſell of <hi>Salomon</hi> the wiſe; Glorie not of to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 27.</note> morow, for thou knoweſt not what to morow will bring.

Now if in ſo ſhort a time, as a man may put the cuppe to his mouth, many things oftentimes do wonderfully al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: what madneſſe is it, and vanitie of vanitie to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine long before of thinges to come? and if vve can not promiſe to our ſelues the euents of one day, neyther can be aſſured what ſhall fall out to morovv; vvhat preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pryde is it to promiſe our ſelues ſecuritie and continuance of our ſtate, for moneths, yeares and termes of time at our ovvne pleaſure? the firſt reaſon therefore vvhy the Saints of God, neyther any other what ſoeuer, ſhould not ſay in this wiſe, to daye or to morrovve vvill vve goe into ſuch a citie; is becauſe the time, and euent of things is vncertaine, neither can we tel what to morow wil bring vnto vs.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Now as we ought not thus to determine of things to come, becauſe the time is vncertaine, and the euent of things doubtfull: ſo neither ought we thus to determine; becauſe our life is fraile, brittle, vnſtable, and of all things moſt vncertaine. For vvhich cauſe it may be compared <note place="margin">The vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of mans life.</note> vnto a vapour in the ayre, carried vp by the beames of the ſun, which there is diſperſed ſuddenly, and vaniſheth. Wherefore vvee are not able to promiſe any thing abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to our ſelues: ſo fraile is our ſtate, ſo tranſitorie is our life, and our daies ſo ſhort and vncertaine.</p>
               <p>And touching the ſhortneſſe of mans life, and the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:19545:259"/> vncertaintie of our worldly condition, it is a large fielde to walke in: it is a moſte ample ſcope; it is a thing vvhereof many haue ſpoken many thinges: this the holy Scripture preacheth, thereof the men of God haue vvitneſſed; to that, experience of all men and vvomen vvhich haue bene in former age, ſubſcribeth.</p>

This Apoſtle to diſcipher and diſcouer vnto vs the greate vveakeneſſe of our nature and the vncertaintie of our life, compareth it alſo to a vapour, a thing of ſhort conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.</p>
               <p>The very Heathen and naturall men, by the onely light of nature, haue ſeene no leſſe, and haue confeſſed the ſame: painted out the frailtie of our nature, and the ſhortneſſe of our life in a diuerſe manner. Some haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led man a bubble, vvhich riſeth and falleth ſuddenly. <hi>Pindarus</hi> the Poet termeth a man, a thing of one dayes <note place="margin">Pindarus.</note> continuance: and againe he calleth man the dreame of a ſhadovv: a ſhadovv ſeemeth to be ſomething and is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: and to dreame of a ſhadovv, is leſſe then nothing: yet doth he call man, the dreame of a ſhadovv. A certaine philoſopher being asked vvhat the life of man vvas, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared it to the playing of a parte vpon a ſtage and ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, vvhereon the plaier ſtandeth a little vvhile: fetcheth a turne or tvvo, and ſo departeth: euen ſo playeth man his part vpon the ſtage of this vvorld, vvhereon he turneth and vvalketh a vvhile and then departeth.</p>
               <p>Another of the Poetes calleth man a breath and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovv only, then vvhich nothing more ſubiect to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Sophocles.</note> to vanitie. Therefore haue ſome made large and long diſcourſes: and vvrite vvhole bookes of the miſery, vanitie and shortnes of mans life. The truth vvhereof experience of al men and vvomen that haue bene before vs, ſhevveth. For vvhere is novv <hi>Adam, Cain, Abel, Noe?</hi> vvhere are the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Ioſeph,</hi> &amp; the reſt? vvhere are the Prophets, <hi>Moſes, Elias, Nathan, Michea, Iſai, Ieremie.

Where are the Apoſtles and Martyrs? Where are all the men of might, and ſuch as for vertue haue bene renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? where are all men, women, rich, poore, yoong, old, learned, ignorant, wiſe, fooliſh, high, low, baſe, honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:19545:260"/> princes and people which haue gone before vs? is it not manifeſt in them all, that this our earthly life, is no better then a vapour? the conſideration whereof ſhould keepe vs from preſumpteous determining of things to come. Let vs therefore oppoſe our miſerable ſtate and wretched condition to this vaine confidence, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our pryde may be abated, for which things ſake it is here ſet downe by the Apoſtle, as a reaſon to diſſuade vs from our vaine confidence. Seeing therefore that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents of times are doubtfull, and our life a thing vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, it were meere madneſſe for vs thus to preſume of our ſelues, and in the vaine confidence of our heartes to determine of thinges to come, long before; which thing here is condemned by the Apoſtle; and diſſuaded by this double reaſon: Goe to now you that ſay, to day or to morrow will wee go into ſuch a citie, and continue there a yeare; and bie and ſell, and gaine; yet ye can not tell what ſhalbe to morow: for what is your life? it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a vapour, which appeareth for a time, and afterward vaniſheth away.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The thing condemned and the reaſons, why, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered: in the third place followeth a correcting of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: in ſtead of ſaying, to day and to morow we wil go to ſuch a citie: let vs ſay, if the Lord will, and if we liue, we will do this or that; thus correcteth he the euill: for yee ought to ſay, ſaith he, if the Lord will, &amp; if we liue, we will do this or that.</p>
               <p>It is a ſpeciall point of godlineſſe, in all things that are to be done, firſt to make honourable mention of the Lords will and pleaſure: and euermore to recount and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord our owne frailneſſe: and in all things to ſay, if the Lord wil, and if we liue, we wil do this or that. Our whole life relieth vpon him: in him it is onely to direct all our waye,: without his leaue can wee doe nothing, lette vs therefore referre all things to his will, and ſay as wee are taught by the Apoſtle; if the Lord will, and if we liue, we will do this or that.</p>
               <p>The whole courſe of mans life is ruled by God, the
<pb facs="tcp:19545:261"/> heart of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi> purpoſeth his way, but the Lord <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 16. <hi>Prou.</hi> 20.</note> directeth his ſteppes: the ſteps of man are ruled by the Lord, how can a man then vnderſtand his owne waies? I know ſaith <hi>Ieremie,</hi> that the way of man is not in himſelfe; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ierem.</hi> 20.</note> neyther is it in man to guide and direct his ſteps. And this is not onely true in walking after the law of God, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting our liues according to his vvill, which without his ſpeciall fauour and grace cannot be: but of the whole courſe of our life, which is altogether directed by his pleaſure &amp; prouidence: wherfore in all things, men ought to prefer the will of God. To which purpoſe our Sauiour Chriſt, putteth a petition, concerning the will of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.</note> the things appertaining vnto this life. What can any man, otherwiſe of neuer ſo great might do, without the will of God? if <hi>Pharao</hi> could haue done any thing by his <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.</note> owne abſolute power, without the vvill of God: then had the Iſraelites at once bene ouerthrowen, &amp; his kingdome in ſecuritie. If <hi>Aman</hi> could haue done any thing vvithout <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſter.</hi> 3.</note> the vvill of God, then had <hi>Mardocai</hi> gone to the pot, and all the men of the Ievviſh nation. If <hi>Sennacherib</hi> could haue done any thing vvithout Gods vvill, then <hi>Hezechia</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. <hi>Kings.</hi> 18. 19. <hi>Reue.</hi> 12.</note> had bene plagued by the Aſſyrians. If the deuill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe could doe any thing vvithout the vvill of God, then long ſince had the vvhole Church of God bene deſtroied vtterly. No man, neyther in theſe like matters, nor in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ciuill affayres can doe any thing, but according as God hath determined, and after his vvill: for vvhich cauſe in all things and actions vve aduenture and enterpriſe, vve muſt preferre his vvil, if God will.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> tooke his leaue of the Epheſians, readie <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</note> a proſperous iournie vnto them, by the vvil of God.

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:19545:261"/> preferreth the will of the Lord, and ſaith: If that the Lord will: wherefore he ſaith; But I wil come ſhortly vnto you, if the Lord will, and will know, not the wordes of them which are puffed vp, but the power. And againe, I will not now ſee you in my iourney, but I truſt to abide a while <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16</note> with you, if the Lord permitte. In all his determinations had he ſpeciall reſpect to the will of God, as is apparant. By whoſe example, according to this councel, muſt men correct their vanitie, and fooliſh ſpeaches: If the Lorde will, we will doe this, or that. Seeing Gods will muſt be preferred in al things, who at his owne pleaſure, &amp; by his diuine prouidence, ruleth ouer all: if we can doe nothing without him, in whom onely we haue our life, being, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 17.</note> mouing: what temeritie and raſhnes, what impietie and vngodlines is it, in this pride of our heartes, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny regarde had to his will, of our ſelues to determine any thing?</p>
               <p>Now (as Gods wil) muſt firſt be preferred to all our actions: So alſo, hauing reſpect to our mortalitie, &amp; fraile condition, ſubiect to ſpeedie death, wee alſo adde; If wee liue: which is requiſite to our determinations, ſeeing our life is ſo vncertaine. The Apoſtle therefore, to correcte this greate euill and miſchiefe of pride: whereby men in vaine confidence, promiſe to themſelues many matters, and determine long before of things vncertaine: in that they ſay; To day, or to morrow we will goe into ſuch a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and continue there a yeare, and by, and ſell, &amp; gaine: teacheth vs in ſtead thereof to ſay; if the Lord will, and if we liue, we wil doe this, or that.</p>
               <p>This, euen reaſon it ſelfe (beſide the word of GOD) teacheth vs: for is it not reaſon that we ſhould ſay, by his leaue we will doe this, or that, from whom wee haue our life, our mouing, and being? and this we haue from God: is it not reaſon that we ſhould yeelde our ſelues vnder his will? Wherefore <hi>Socrates</hi> (taught by naturall reaſon this doctrine) willeth <hi>Alcibiades</hi> in all thinges to ſay; If God <note place="margin">Socrates,</note> will. Chriſtians ought therefore (rather by the worde of trueth taught) to learne this leſſon, leaſt in their affaires,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:262"/> determinations, counſells and buſines not preferring Gods will, they be worſe then the very heathen.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Haue not our age hatched many ſuch birdes, as ſay not only not, if God will, we will do this, or that, but will he nill he, we will do it.

But let all ſuch as feare God bee aduiſed by the Apoſtle, and correcte the vanitie of their pride, and ſay in all things, if the Lorde will, and if we liue, wee will doe this or that, as heere wee are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Yet is it not the purpoſe of the holie Ghoſte heere to condemne all for proude and wicked, who at all times and in all things vſe not thus to ſay, if the Lorde will and if wee liue, we will do this or that.

And in all things and at all times to repeate the vvordes, might ſeeme vaine ſuperſtition, and babling follie. But the ſpirite of God in this place is vehemently caried avvay vvith iuſte condemnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch, as vvith out regard had to the good pleaſure of God, or reſpect had to the mortalytie of our nature, vvould haue all times, ſeaſons, things and euents, to ſerue them at their wills, for which cauſe in the pride of their hartes they determine preſumtuouſly of things to come: and ſay in their vaine confidence, to day or to morow will we go into ſuch a cittie, and there continue a yeare, &amp; by and ſell and gaine, which thing the Apoſtle condemneth
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:19545:262"/> and correcteth, and in ſtead thereof, teacheth vs to ſay; If the Lord will, and if we liue, we will doe this thing, or that thing.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The Apoſtle hauing thus reproued the ſinne, and corrected this euil among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the fourth place he repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſame vice and miſchiefe, with reprehenſion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in other words, yet to like purpoſe: and therefore ſaith; You reioyce in your boaſting, all ſuch reioycing is euill: you doe not onely conceaue ſuch vaine confidence in your heartes, but you alſo vtter it in your wordes: neither doe you only vtter it in wordes, and in your ſpeaches, but alſo you boaſt of your ſayings: you reioyce in your boaſtings: all ſuch reioycing is euill.

               <p>Which concluſion ſeemeth to be added, to preuent &amp; turne away an obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which theſe proud perſons might haue made: They might haue ſaid vnto him; we know this well inough, you need not tel vs, that Gods will ought to be preferred before all things, as the rule of all our actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: we knowe that in all our determinations, wee muſt haue regard to his pleaſure, &amp; the ſhortnes of our life: we know men ſhould rather ſay, if the Lord will, and if we liue, wee will doe this, or that.

               <p>This concerneth the ſoueraigne and the ſubiect: the paſtour and the people: the father and the child: the wife and the husband: the maiſter and the ſeruant: the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and the ſouldier: the iudge and the officer: the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant and the occupier: the handie crafts man, and the labourer: one man and another: euery man and woman in particular, and generally all, that if they know their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, what, and how to do well, and do it not: then are they compaſſed and helde with the greater ſinne.

                  <p>Let rich men make neuer ſo great account of their manifolde and coſtly ſuites of apparell: of their gay garments and fine cloathing: yet all this is but vanitie, and ſubiect vnto the moth, (of wormes, or flies), not the greateſt.

VVhat our Sauiour generally applieth to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as a way to bring them to corruption: the ſame our Apoſtle particularly applyeth to one part of riches, which is apparell, and telleth the riche men of the worlde, that their riches are corrupt and eaten with moth. Your garments are moth-eaten. Wherefore when we thinke our garments without harme, hurt, or daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in our Cheſtes or Preſſes, faire bruſhed, well foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, carefully layde vppe: euen then is the moth in eating, and the vile Worme in conſuming of them.</p>
                  <p>And if any man ſhoulde here ſay, all garments are not conſumed and eaten with moth: for wee can keepe our fine apparell from that well inough, that they ſhall not thus periſh: thereunto bee it anſwered, that yet our apparell is thereunto ſubiect: and that oftentimes it thus commeth to paſſe, or by like wayes that our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are conſumed. The Apoſtle hauing regarde to that way of their conſuming which is moſt vſuall, and commeth moſt naturally of themſelues: as the moth groweth of apparell it ſelfe, which it alſo conſumeth: telleth the rich men, that as their riches generally are ſubiect to corruption: euen ſo particularly their gay and gallant garments, their curious and coſtly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, is alſo ſubiect to moth-eating: your garments are moth-eaten.</p>
                  <p>If there bee no greater ſtay nor certaintie in riches, and ſpecially in apparell then this: if they bee ſo ſubiect to alteration and corruption, that the vile moth is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conſume them: what doting follie, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame madneſſe is it for men to waxe proude of things, ſo vaine, or put any truſte in ſuch vncertaineneſſe? VVherefore ſeeing you riche men of the earth, vvaxe

For your riches are corrupt, and your garments are moth-eaten.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Another chiefe part of riches, wherein greater <note place="margin">Golde and ſiluer.</note> confidence is repoſed, is golde and ſiluer. Which of all mettall or things growing in the mineralls and bowels of the earth, is the fineſt and moſt pure: yet haue they alſo their conſuming and corruption: for the ruſt and canker eateth and conſumeth thoſe things alſo. And this experience teacheth: if it be golde in our bagges and coffers: or plate in our Cheſts: the one, and the other is ſubiect to canker and ruſt: money is oftentimes kept ſo long, as that the canker hath eaten into it, and the ruſt hath conſumed it. Howe is it elſe that wee ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue money in payments, as greene as a leeke with ruſt: eaten in ſundrie places with the canker? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe either long kept, or loſt for a time, it gathereth cauſe of it owne corruption, and thus is oftentimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, which all mens eyes at one time or another doe ſee: doeth not the dayly vſe of man, the often vſing, the much handling, the often deliuering of money from man to man, ſhew that money, golde, or ſiluer is ſubiect to corruption: in as much as by theſe daylie vſes it weareth?

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:19545:275"/> So that the Apoſtle may truely ſay thereof, as ofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt commeth to paſſe, and whereunto naturally theſe things are inclined: that their golde and ſiluer is can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerd: and thus the chiefeſt and moſt ſpeciall treaſures of men, and the greateſt matter of their wealth and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by theſe means are conſumed, and come to nothing: for which cauſe they haue to weepe and howle for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which ſhould come vpon them.</p>
                  <p>VVherefore as the drunkerd and ſurfetter weepeth and howleth without hope or comfort, when the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his exceſſe, as wine and delicate meates are taken away from him: and as the proude man conſumeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way when the matter whereof he is proude, is remoued: and the ambicious perſon languiſheth with ſorrow, pineth away vvith griefe, falleth avvay vvith heauineſſe of heart, vvhen the hope of his honour is gone and periſhed: euen ſo ought the prophane and vvicked riche men of this vvorlde: ſeeing their riches, as apparell, golde and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, is ſubiect to corruption, vvherein they ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced, and delighted: ſeeing the things vvherein they truſted, and repoſed the vvhole hope of their happineſſe, are and ſhall bee vtterly and altogether remooued, come to nothing and be conſumed: vveepe and hovvle, as men vvithout hope: for theſe miſeries vvhich thus ſhall come vpon them: vvhereunto the Apoſtle in this denouncing and threatning of them their deſtruction, calleth them: Goe to novve yee rich men, vveepe and hovvle for the miſeries vvhich ſhall come vppon you: your riches are corrupt: your garments are moth-eaten: your golde and ſiluer is cankerd.

<pb facs="tcp:19545:285"/> gone vp into the eares of the Lord of hoſts.</p>
               <p>Which place containeth no ſmall comfort vnto the poore afflicted ſaints of God; in that the Lord is called the Lord of hoſtes, who being mighty in power, &amp; hauing all the creatures in heauen &amp; earth at a bay, and vſeth them at his will as his hoſte &amp; armie, proteſteth &amp; profeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be the protectour and defence of his ſeruaunts.

               <p>The firſt euill then in this place condemned, and for which this ſentence of iudgement is gone out againſt the prophane riche men of the worlde, is their fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent detaining and withholding of their labourers wages, the crie whereof entred into the eares of the Lorde of hoſts.</p>

               <p>Pleaſure heere ſignifieth the deliciouſneſſe of men in this life, whereunto they giue themſelues, that they faring deliciouſly euerie daie, may ſpende their time and life in pleaſure like Epicures: by the which, they are not onely condemned as iniurious vnto others, but alſo are accuſed as miſpending that which they detaine from their workemen, vpon their owne pleaſure and delights.

               <p>To which their wantonnes, as they are too prone by naturall inclination, ſo haue they many prickes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uokements: as, filthie ſonges and ſonnets, which by their eares, paſſe on to their hearts: laughter, merimentes, ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, which are not comely: immodeſt and vnchaſt mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, whereby the adulterous heartes of men and women are ſet on fire and inflamed: dalliance, toying, ieſture not conuenient, filthie ſpeach and talke, the verie inſtrument

               <p n="3">3 Of their ſenſualytie the laſte and third branch is, that they nouriſhed their heartes as in the day of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Whereby their continual ſtudie to banquet and make merie is noted, that their whole life might be as it were a continual day of feaſting: by which they grew as fatte as porke or brawne, for ſatan the deuill to feade on, in the day of iudgmente,</p>
               <p>The Hebrues call the daies of feaſting, the daies of ſlaughter. Becauſe at great feaſtes, there is great killyng, great ſlaughter. Calues from the ſtalle, ſheepe from the folde, oxen from the paſture, kyddes from the goates, lambes from the ewes, deere from the forreſte, bucke from the chaſe, fiſh from the ſea, foule from the fenne, birdes from the aire, capons from the coope, feſant from the woode, partrige from the couie, rabbet from the warrant, and infinite the like are then ſlayne to bee deuoured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that the daies of feaſting may welbe called the dayes of ſlaughter. The prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> ſpeaking of the day of Iſraels deſtruction by <hi>Nabuchodonoſour</hi> King of Babilon, wherein <note place="margin">

Whereunto the Apoſtle Saint <hi>James</hi> in this place hauing regarde, painting out the inſaciable deſire and ſtudie in the wicked rich men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to feade and fatten them ſelues by banquetting &amp; feaſting, ſaith that they nouriched them ſelues as to the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:19545:287"/> day of ſlaughter: preparing themſelues day by day, to fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and banquetting: though it be with the hurt, neede, and hungerſtaruing of the poore people of the land. For like fault may not we geue like iudgement, &amp; pronounce like ſentence of condemnation againſt the riche men of theſe daies? Did not they in the great famine of the land, wherewith the poor were miſerably pinched, ſit ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">

You liue in pleaſure and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes; you nouriſh your hearts as in the day of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; you feaſt your ſelues with the goods of the poore; you pamper vp your ſelues with the penurie of your brethren; you fare deliciouſlie euery day by pinching of the needy; Goe to now therefore, weepe and howle for the miſeries which ſhall come vpon you. Your neighboures ſterue, they peariſh with hunger, with whom you haue to doe: the diſtreſſed with famine, die in your ſtreetes, and yet you prolong your feaſting and banquetting continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: weepe therefore and howle, for the miſeries which ſhall come vpon you: who liue in pleaſure on the earth, who geue your ſelues to wantonnes, and carnal luſts; you nouriſh your hearts as in the day of ſlaughter: geuing your ſelues to daily banquerting, and feeding your ſelues full, much like vnto fedde beaſtes, prepared for the ſlaughter.</p>
               <p>Albeit, there be ſome couetous rich men, ſo farre from pampering vp themſelues in this manner, as that they cannot affoorde themſelues a good dinner or ſupper once in a quarter, and that for very miſerablenes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaciable couetouſnes of their mindes: which thing is one of the vexations vnder the ſunne, ſpoken of by king <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccles.</hi> 6.</note> in his preacher; When men haue riches, but yet not a liberall heart to vſe them for their comfort: who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may well be compared to <hi>Tantalus,</hi> king of Phrygia,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:288"/> whom poets faine (for diſcloſing the councel of the gods) to be tormented in hell, with apples ouer his head, which (as he reached for them) departed, and went vp higher: and water vnder him, whereunto when he ſtouped, it flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed away: ſo that he could neither eate nor drinke in his torments: yet becauſe for the moſt part, theſe braunches of ſenſualitie, are commonly in the prophane men of the world: therefore he reproueth it, as a thing incident to that condition of men. And this is the ſeconde euill, for which the Apoſtle denounceth this fearefull iudgement, and vtter deſtruction againſt them.</p>
               <p>The third ſinne and euill, for which theſe men are <note place="margin">3. <hi>Euil, or ſinne in the couetous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
                  </note> ſubiect to this iudgement, is their crueltie, which in theſe two things appeareth. 1 That they condemne the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men. 2 That they condemne them not only, but alſo ſlay them, when they make no reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The wicked men of this world condemne the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous at their pleaſures; they geue what ſentence they luſt againſt the iuſt and godly men: they iudge the innocent at their willes, if in all thinges they doe not pleaſe them: which is great crueltie, and a thing abhominable before God. For he that abſolueth the wicked in iudgement, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 17.</note> condemneth the righteous, both are abhominable before God, ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither do theſe only wrongfully iudge &amp; conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne the righteous: but alſo they ſlay him, and hee reſiſteth them not, This is fiercenes, and intollerable crueltie.</p>
               <p>Now the righteous is ſlaine diuers waies. 1 In heart by hatred: Hee that hateth his brother in his heart, is a murtherer (ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn.)</hi> 2 In tongue by ſlaunder: therefore Chriſt conteineth it vnder the nature of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.</note> making it ſubiect to like iudgement. 3 Or by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying helpe in their miſerie, wherein wee ſuffer them to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5</note> peariſh without ſuccour. 4 Or when by fraud, or force, we take, or holde from men, that which is their owne: wherby, as much as in vs lieth, we murther them. 5 Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> finally, we bereaue men of their liues. Which al agre with this place of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> and are found in the rich wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:19545:288"/> men of this world: who albeit themſelues, by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, doe not alwaies theſe thinges; yet ſith by their meanes and power theſe are done, therefore are they ſaid to doe it. So partly by themſelues, partly by others, the rich prophane men of the world, condemne and ſlaye the righteous, when he reſiſteth them not: which thing is a point of great crueltie. For can there be any crueltie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to that, to waxe fierce, to rage furiouſlie againſt him that reſiſteth not? Is not this ſauagenes farre excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the crueltie of the Lion; before whom if a man fall downe, and lie proſtrate, ſeeming neither to ſtirre, ſtriue, nor ſtruggle, the Lion often ſuffereth him, and toucheth him not? But theſe (more rauening then Wolues, more hungrie then beares, more greedie then Tygers, more cruell then Lions) fall vpon the righteous to ſlaye him, when he reſiſteth not.</p>

               <p>What ſhall we ſay then?

               <p>Hereunto I anſwere; though it be commaunded vs that we ſhall not reſiſt, and commended in the righteous men, that they did not reſiſt their oppreſſours: yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, that the righteous may not at all reſiſt. For, touching the commaundement of Chriſt, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, it is apparant, that they ſpake of impatient reſiſting, &amp; of ſuch reſiſting as was ioyned with greedie deſire of priuate reuenge: in which manner, the Saints of God are euery where forbidden to reſiſt.</p>
               <p>In other reſpects it is not vnlawful to reſiſt: but ether by auoyding their oppreſſions; either by telling the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of their iniuries; or finally, by repelling force by force, when we cannot haue the lawfull ayde of Magiſtrates, it is lawful to reſiſt the wicked when they oppreſſe vs; which doctrine may be warranted out of the vnfallible word of trueth.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt commaunded his Diſciples to flie from Citie to Citie, when rhey were perſecuted: and <note place="margin">

               <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> writing to <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> diligently <note place="margin">Epistol. S.

As Chriſt and <hi>Paul</hi> his Apoſtle in minde and heart prepared to death it ſelfe: yet outwardly did and ſpoke that, which might beſt repreſſe and reſtraine the aduerſarie.</p>
               <p>VVherehence it followeth, when by bearing and ſuffering of men, we make them woorſe rather, then by our pacience, winne and gaine them: then is it our dutie, in minde to prepare our ſelues ſtill to beare: but in our outwarde action, ſpeach and behauiour, to do that which may moſte profite the oppreſſour, and withholde the enemie from further iniurie: and in this wiſe alſo is it permitted the Saintes of GOD, to make reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce: not repugnant to this, or anie like place of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Finally, there are times and ſeaſons, when by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling force by force, it is lawfull to reſiſt alſo. When Chriſtians are ſo narrowly beſteed, and ſo ſtraitly beſet with their enemies, as that they cannot haue the ayde of ciuill powers and lawfull magiſtrates of the common wealth: but muſt either reſiſt by force, or bee in daunger
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:19545:290"/> of the loſſe of their liues and goods, without all recouerie or recompence: in ſuch a caſe to reſiſt I holde it lawfull altogether: ſo that it bee done in a moderate defence of our ſelues, without priuate malice, or deſire of ſhedding of blood.</p>
               <p>If a man in a houſe be beſet with wicked perſons, ſo that he can not haue aide of ciuill power for the preſent inſtant, neither hath hope of recouering the damage which he may ſuſtaine, either of goodes or of life: to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with all ſtrength, power, and courage, and to fight for our goodes, liues, and bodily ſafegarde, is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. If in the high way we bee inwrapped in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, where no Magiſtrates are to ſuccour: wee are as extraordinarie Magiſtrates to our ſelues to withſtande force by force, violence, by violence, might by might. VVhich properly is not violence or iniurie, but lawfull defence, which nature it ſelfe hath imprinted and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the hearts of men.</p>

               <p>And our bleſſed Sauiour Chriſt permitted his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 22.</note> to carrie and weare ſwoordes about them, for their owne defence, when they coulde not haue the lawfull ayde of princes and Magiſtrates. So that albeit hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued <hi>Peter</hi> for ſmiting with the ſwoorde, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the eare of <hi>Malchus:</hi> for that then the magiſtrate and ciuill officer was at hande, and ſhoulde haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his innocencie: yet at other times, and when they went abroade, he permitted them to weare weapons.

               <p>Nowe as in ſome caſes it is lawfull to make priuate reſiſtance to priuate men, howſoeuer blockiſh Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts chatte, chirpe, or chatter to the contrarie: ſo may it be demaunded, whether it may ſtand with a righteous and iuſt mans dutie, to make publike reſiſtance by warre, and publike reuengement.</p>
               <p>I anſwere that theſe places doe not forbidde lawful warres. Which to bee a thing lawfull in the Saintes of God, it may manie wayes appeare euidently: the olde and the newe Teſtament confirmeth it: the examples of renowmed men highly euen therefore commended, approue it.</p>

               <p>The holy and bleſſed Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> deſcribing <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.</note> vnto the Saintes that golden chaine of all excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, wherewith he would haue all the elect of God to be adorned, and beautified, as the moſt incomparable orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their life: maketh patience the fifth linke ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whereunto in this wiſe he perſwadeth, therfore giue all diligence thereunto; Ioyne moreouer, vertue with faith, and with vertue, knowledge; with knowledge, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance; with temperance, patience; with patience, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines; with godlines, brotherly kindnes; with brotherly kindnes, loue. For if theſe things be in you, and abound, they will make you not to be idle, nor vnfruitefull in the acknowledging of our Lorde and onely Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and infinite other the like places wee haue, generally mouing vs to this excellent and commendable vertue, patience.</p>
               <p>Particularly the Apoſtle in this place exhorteth to patience, which is, in bearing and ſuffering the iniuries
<pb facs="tcp:19545:296"/> and cruell oppreſſions of prophane rich men: by whoſe tyrannie and cruell dealing, they were marueylouſlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, which they ought with all patience to beare, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and wayting for the comming of the Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, to auenge their cauſes, and quarrelles againſt the wicked.</p>
               <p>Our holy and bleſſed Sauiour Chriſt, in particular exhorteth vnto patience: which in the bearing of violence <note place="margin">

Reſiſt not euill (ſaith our ſauiour Chriſt) but if one ſmite thee on the one cheeke, offer vnto him the other: and if he ſue thee at the lawe, to take away thy coate from thee; let him haue thy cloake alſo: if he conſtraine thee to goe with him a mile, go two. Whereby our Sauiour exhorteth the Saintes, to prepare themſelues alwaies againſt iniuries: and with all patience and quietnes of their mindes, to beare the oppreſſions of men, which wrongfully ſhould be offered. Hereunto this Apoſtle hauing reſpect, willeth and exhorteth the Saints, to beare the iniuries and cruell oppreſſions of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, with patience: and with all godly quietnes to wayte for the comming of Ieſus Chriſt. Be ye therefore patient, ſaith the Apoſtle Saint <hi>James,</hi> vntill the comming of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Wherein we are taught, that ſeeing we muſt ſtay our ſelues, and ſettle our hearts, and with patience runne the race of afflictions, vntill the comming of Chriſt: therfore, both the reward of their patience, and other vertues of the Saints, and alſo the puniſhment of their aduerſaries and oppreſſours, are reſerued till the day of Chriſt, till his comming in glorious maieſtie, to iudge the quick and the dead, and to geue ſentence againſt all men.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, albeit the Saintes of God haue ſome ſmall and little feeling of their future ioyes, and glorie to come: as in the meditating vpon heauenly thinges, in the ſetled peace and quietnes of our conſciences with God; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</note> and the like: and the wicked alſo, euen in this life, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time feele and taſt of their extreame calamities to come, <note place="margin">

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:19545:296"/> anguiſh of their ſoules; the great vexation of their minds; and the comfortleſſe ſorrowe of their hearts, which they often ſuffer: Yet neither the Saints ſhall haue the conſum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mation of their ioyes: neither the wicked the full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their puniſhments, before the day of iudgement, and comming of Ieſus Chriſt. Wherefore S. <hi>Iames</hi> here exhorteth the Saints to waite for both theſe til the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The conſideration hereof is comfortable, and the knowledge therof moſt profitable to the Saints: wherfore we may note this in particular a little.</p>
               <p>And firſt for the glorie of the Saints, and their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, it is in perfect meaſure to be looked for, only at the appearing of Ieſus Chriſt in glorious maieſtie.

                     <hi>Luke</hi> 21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31.</note> ſhould forerunne it, exhorteth them againſt that day, to lifte vp their heads, to be of good cheare, and to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, becauſe their redemption approached: then onely promiſing them full deliuerance from miſeries, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect redemption of ſoule and body. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth to the Romanes, that in this life they ſhould be ſubiect to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8</note> manifold afflictions and troubles, euen as the Lord Ieſus Chriſt was: and that here there is no ende of affliction to be looked for, but we muſt waite for that, til the comming of Chriſt: which with ſighing and ſorrowing he witneſſed they waited for, euen the deliuerance, and redemption of their bodies. This glorious redemption onlie is perfected at the comming of the Lord. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the church <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.</note> of Coloſſa, auoucheth that our life is hid with Chriſt: and that when Chriſt which is our life, ſhall appeare, then ſhal we alſo appeare with him in glorie.

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> the ſonne, and to be made like vnto him? But wee come not to that perfect conformitie and likenes with Chriſt, in this mortall life, but in the life to come: therefore the <note place="margin">

               <p> Saint Iohn therefore ſaith, now are wee the ſonnes of God, but yet it is not made manifeſt what we ſhalbe: &amp; we knowe that when he ſhall appeare, we ſhalbe like vn to him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is. Thus the glorie of Gods Saintes, in perfect beutie ſhall not appeare before Ieſus Chriſt be reueiled againe from heauen.

<pb facs="tcp:19545:298"/> of iudgement. VVherfore hee ſaith: Many of them that ſleepe in the duſt ſhall awake: Manie, that is all: ſome to life: that is the rewarde of the godly: ſome to ignomnie and perpetuall contempt, as the wicked. Chriſt teacheth the ſame in the parable of the tares and the wheate in the <note place="margin">

In another place it is auouched, that both the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. 5. <hi>Iohn</hi> 29.</note> righteous ſhould hear their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable &amp; ioyful ſentence of entering into their kingdome only at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and the wicked the dreadful voice of their final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, to be caſt downe into hel fire, therein to be puniſhed with the diuell and his angels for euer. Finally, S. <hi>Paul</hi> wryteth, that in the day of Chriſts comming one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor. c.</hi> 5.</note> wee ſhall all appeare before his tribunall ſeate, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one to receyue according to that which hee hath done in his bodie, be it good, be it euill. So then it appeareth moſt manifeſtly, that neither reward is giuen the Saints, nor puniſhment rendered the wicked in full and perfect meaſure, before the day and comming of the Lord Ieſus: which thing Saint <hi>James</hi> to perſwade vs, willeth the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Saints of God to be pacient till the comming of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Before which time, neither <hi>Abel,</hi> nor <hi>Noah,</hi> nor <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch:</hi> neither <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> nor <hi>Iacob:</hi> neither <hi>Ioſeph</hi> nor <hi>Iob,</hi> nor any of the Patriarkes: neither <hi>Elias,</hi> nor <hi>Iſai: Michai</hi> nor <hi>Ieremie: Daniel</hi> nor <hi>Amos:</hi> neither any of the Prophets.

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:19545:298"/> conſummation of their bleſſedneſſe. Neither <hi>Cain</hi> nor <hi>Iſmael, Eſau, Saul,</hi> nor <hi>Pharaoh, Ahab,</hi> nor <hi>Iudas,</hi> nor <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> nor any of the rabble of that wicked route, haue their full puniſhment: but it is reſerued vntill the comming of the Lorde: when, as the ſoules and bodies of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhall bee cladde with immortalitie and glorie: ſo alſo the bodies and ſoules of the wicked, ſhall bee caſt into eternall torment. Thus Saint <hi>Iames</hi> partly to bee a comfort to the godly, and partly for a terrour to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, exhorteth the Saints to bee pacient vnto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The exhortation thus ſet downe, the next and ſecond thing in this diſcourſe of pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, is the ſimilitude, which the Apoſtle vſeth to ſhew them how they ought to be pacient. And it ſeemeth to bee added to preuent that which the poore afflicted might haue obiected: we (might they ſay) haue beene pacient a long while, and waited for deliuerance from our oppreſſions and miſeries: yet ſee we no remedie: we finde no ende of our troubles: it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the Lord deferreth his comming to auenge vs of the prophane rich men, which grieuouſly do afflict vs: what ſhall we nowe do then? You muſt (ſaith <hi>James)</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate and followe the wiſe and skilfull husband man, who endureth all weathers: paciently abideth the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſeaſons: is not diſcouraged by any meanes: who caſting the ſeede into the ground, thinketh not long for harueſt, but wayteth the appoynted time therevnto: in the meane time endureth manie thinges paciently. So muſt you, O my brethren, waite the Lordes leyſure, in paciencie of your mindes: who hath prefixed and prefined the day of your deliuerance from theſe oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of your enemies: vntill which time you muſt reſt your ſelues contented. And this is the ſumme of the Apoſtles ſimilitude, wherein there are three things to be noted. 1 The ſimilitude. 2 The application. 3 The reaſon annexed.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The ſimilitude: beholde the husband man way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for the precious fruites of the earth, and hath long
<pb facs="tcp:19545:299"/> pacience for it, vntill he receiue the former and the later <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 6.</note> raine.</p>
               <p>The fruites of the earth are here called precious, becauſe they are the meanes of our nouriſhment, and the inſtrument of the preſeruation of our life. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corne and graine, our life is not, ne yet can bee maintayned: and therefore are they in deede precious. This precious fruite the husbande-man committeth to the grounde, where hee leaueth it, and letteth it alone for a ſeaſon, paciently wayting for the time of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, and hath long pacience: for from ſeede time to harueſt, time hee wayteth for the encreaſe of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: and in the meane time many ſtormie tempeſts, manie glowmie dayes, many rainie ſhowers, many altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of weather, are inflicted.</p>
               <p>Hee hath long pacience till hee receyue the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <note place="margin">Early and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rayne.</note> and the latter raine. The earely or former raine, is that raine which falleth immediately after ſeede time, whereby the graine is beaten into the bowels and boſom of the earth, that there it may bee couered, that it may haue ſome roote and faſtening in the heart of the earth.</p>
               <p>The latter raine, is that which falleth immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before harueſt, which maketh the corne ſwell and yeeld, encreaſe and growe greater and weightier in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Both theſe the husband-man paciently wayteth for. If raine fall not betwixt Michaelmaſſe and Alhalon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride, which is the ſeade time &amp; ſo after: yet he reſteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe contented. If the Sommer be drie and no hope of raine to make the corne ſwell, flower and yeelde, yet he will not be diſcouraged, but waiteth the appointed time with long pacience.</p>
               <p>This hee ſpeaketh of the husband-man, not that there is none of them which murmure &amp; are diſcontent for ſome there bee which are offended at lacke: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are grieued with plentie: ſo that euen among them there is ſometime murmuring: but becauſe the greater part of them are in theſe thinges pacient, and knowe
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:19545:299"/> that they muſte, will they, nill they, abyde the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeaſon: therefore hee ſayeth, the husband-man hath long pacience, till hee receiue the earely and later raine.</p>
               <p>Some referre this former and latter raine, to the lande of promiſe: the lande of Canaan: which they report to bring foorth twiſe yearely: In March firſt, and then againe in September. And then they take the former raine, for that which rypeneth the former croppe: the latter, for that raine which falleth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before September, whereby the latter harueſt is ripened.</p>
               <p>But it ſeemeth that the Apoſtle meaneth generally of al husband-men, who with pacience tary their appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted times, &amp; ſo with long looking for, at length receiue the encreaſe of their labours.</p>
               <p>By the earely and latter raine, the ſeaſonable times of the yeare are ment, which <hi>Moiſes</hi> promiſed vnto Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.</note> the people of God, if they woulde walke in the lawes of the Lord, and be obedient vnto him. The Lord ſaith he, ſhall open vnto thee his good treaſure, euen the heauen to giue raine vnto the lande in due ſeaſon, and to bleſſe all the workes of thy handes. In another place <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26.</note> promiſing a bleſſing vnto them that keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, the Lorde ſayeth in <hi>Moiſes:</hi> I will then ſende you raine in due ſeaſon, and the land ſhall yeeld her encreaſe; and the trees of the fielde ſhall giue their fruite, and your threſhing ſhall reach vnto the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and the vintage ſhall reach vnto the ſowing time, and you ſhall eate your bread in plenteouſneſſe, and dwel in your land ſafely.</p>
               <p>And happily the Prophets in like ſpeaches had like relation and reſpect. For the Prophete <hi>Oſee</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing <note place="margin">

And the Apoſtle alluding to theſe like promiſes of God, affirmeth that the husband man hath long pacience vntill he receaue the former and the later raine: and this is the ſimilitude of the Apoſtle: behold the husband man waiteth for the pretious ſeede of the earth, and hath long patience till be receaue the former and the later raine.</p>

               <p n="3">3 In this treatiſe of patience, the third thing is the handling of the place by the contrarie; you muſt be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and not murmure, which is proper to worldlings and wicked men: who in their miſeries, afflictions, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, through impatiencie, breake out into murmuring. In the ſetting down of this contrarie there are two things to be obſerued. 1 The contrarie it ſelfe, murmuring. 2 The reaſon. Wee muſt be patient, and not murmure, for the Lorde is at hande to rewarde vs in free mercie, if we be patient: or to puniſh vs in ſeuere iuſtice, if we mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure in our afflictions.</p>
               <p>Murmuring is not here generally taken for euery grudging and groyning, either againſt God or man: as <note place="margin">Murmuring what it is.</note> whereof in other places of Scripture is ſpoaken: but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for that murmuring which is againſt men: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith he; grudge not one againſt another.

Or els it is, that muttering, and murmuring, whereby we take it in euill parte, that our ſelues ſhould be ſo toſt and tormoiled; &amp; other ſhould be dealt withall more gently: thinking that wee beare a greater burthen, and heauier croſſe from God, then wee haue deſerued: and that other men (as yet not touched) haue deſerued more.</p>

               <p>And if this moderation and equitie of our minds, be to be ſhewed towards our enemies, for whoſe iniuries and oppreſſions we ought not to murmure, or impaciently to complaine againſt them, vnto god: how much leſſe ought we then to grudge or murmure one againſt another? How much leſſe becommeth it the Saints to grudge and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure one againſt another for the dayly offences which are giuen? For who is he that can liue ſo vprightly, but that in one thing or another, at one time or another, hee ſhall giue offence: If euerie one giue ſome offence vnto another: ſhall we complaine to God in the bitterneſſe of our heart: ſhall we deſire reuenge from God againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? and ſhall we not all then periſh? for no man liueth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome offence giuing.

               <p>This grudging and muttering proceedeth from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paciencie, argueth diſcontentment of the mind, cauſeth mutuall complaining vnto God, and deſireth reuenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as haue done vs iniurie.

Finally, it bringeth condemnation vpon vs: who haue loſt paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: according to the denouncing of the ſcripture: wo be vnto them that haue loſt pacience: thereby falling from dutie to men: from charitie to the brethren, from obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, from truſt in his diuine prouidence, from ſincere imbracing of the Goſpell of Chriſt, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth vnto vs pacience, and ſo we incurre iuſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued condemnation: for which cauſe the holy Apoſtle

               <p>The reaſon why we ſhould not murmure one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt another, is drawne from the preſence of the Lord: who is at hande as a iuſt iudge, to auenge vs of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to crowne vs for our pacience, or puniſh our murmuring.

               <p n="3">3 The thirde reaſon is drawen from the example of <hi>Iob.</hi> Ye haue heard of the patience of <hi>Iob:</hi> and you know what end the Lord made. What the ſufferings and trials of <hi>Job</hi> were; what he ſuffered in his children, in his goods, in his body, by his wife, by his frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, the ſtorie teacheth vs: and it was wonderfull. It had bene a great matter to haue loſt at one time by the Sabeans 500. yoke or oxen, and as many ſhee aſſes, with the death of his ſeruaunts: but at the ſame time and immediatly to heare tidings, that fire from heauen had burnt vp 7000. ſheepe, and all his ſeruaunts &amp; ſheapheards which kept them, encreaſed his triall mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and wonderfully proued his patience. It had bene a great croſſe thus to haue bene bereft and robbed of his riches and ſubſtaunce: but together, to haue his children all at one clap to be ſlaine with the fal of their owne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, when they were making merie, and ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to be oppreſſed with ſtones and timber without all reſcue, helpe, or ſuccour, what a ſtraunge triall was this?</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19545:310"/>
               <p> It had bene much thus to haue loſt both his riches &amp; his children together: but afterward to be ſtroken with botch and boyle from top to toe, that all men abhorred him: what encreaſe of his croſſe, what waight of his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was this?</p>

Wherefore as the onely patterne of rare patience is he propoſed vnto vs in the holy Scriptures of God. Of whom with reuerend mention the Apoſtle ſpeaking, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his example for a reaſon to moue vnto pacience: you haue heard of the pacience of <hi>Job,</hi> and haue knowen what ende the Lord made.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt ſay; how may he be thought a vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie example of patience, who ſhevved ſo many ſignes of impatiencie? he curſed the day of his birth, he vviſhed he had periſhed in the vvombe of his mother: and vttered <note place="margin">

               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:19545:310"/>
               <p> I anſweare, that as his trials were wonderfull, ſo had he diuers and ſundrie conflictes in himſelfe: wherein hee ſhewed the great weakeneſſe and infirmitie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Yet after many combattes and conflictes with his owne reaſon, and naturall wiſdome: after diuers ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges and ſtruglinges againſt his owne weakeneſſe, and fraile affections, in fine and ende, he ſubmitted his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Gods wiſdome: he raunged himſelfe vnder the good pleaſure of the almightie, and became tractable vnto his will: So that hee carried away (like a moſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant and victorious Captaine) moſt glorious victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in all his temptations, and is therefore ſette downe as an example of ſingular patience, to all poſteritie for euermore. Whoſe example we muſt follow; whoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience wee muſt imitate; whoſe vertue we muſt imbrace; whereunto we are referred in this place: You haue heard of the patience of <hi>Iob;</hi> and you haue knowen what end the Lord made.</p>
               <p>As the patience of <hi>Iob</hi> was rare: ſo the gracious and mercifull Lord, gaue and made a good ende thereof: for he both gaue him ſtrength to preuaile againſt all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and bleſſed him in the ende, after his ſundrie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. Sathan tempted him, but did not ſubdue him; anguiſh and griefe of minde aſſailed him, but did not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe him; loſſe of goods, loſſe of children, and all that euer the man had: troubled him, but did not ouercome him; inhumanitie of men, wickednes of wife, ſoreneſſe of bodie, preſſed him, but did not caſt him downe; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie and affliction diſquieted him, yet therein was hee more then conquerour, through the aſſiſtance and help of God: who in all thinges gaue him good ſucceſſe and iſſue: and in the ende encreaſed and doubled his wealth; multiplied his children, enlarged his daies, and bleſſed <note place="margin">

               <p>By whoſe example, if wee ſuffer loſſe of our goods, death of frends, decay of wealth, oppreſſions of men, iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:311"/> and manifold afflictions which here ſhalbe offred vs: then will the Lord alſo look downe fauourablie vpon vs; then wil he ſend happy ſucceſſe, good iſſue, bleſſed end, to our afflictions alſo: euen in ſorrow, ioy; in bonds, freedom; in priſon, libertie; in ſicknes, health; in trouble, comfort; in death, life; and in miſerie, happines, and true felicitie: let vs therfore by his example learne to be patient.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The laſt reaſon is drawen from the nature of god, who in puniſhing vs any manner of way, yea euen by the oppreſſions and iniuries of the wicked, is therin merciful, howſoeuer he ſeem to our corrupt affections, ſeuere, rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and hard.

               <p>Albeit then, God for great and iuſt cauſe, lay afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon our loines; though hee cauſe vs to paſſe through <note place="margin">

               <p>Let vs therefore in our afflictions reſpect the nature of God, who bringeth calamitie vpon men, not alwaies in rigour, and ſeueritie of his iudgements: but oftentimes in mercie; thereby to correct enormities in our nature: as the mercifull and pittifull Surgeons and Phyſicions, doe many things which are painfull to the patient: thereby to correct and repreſſe corrupte humors, and other infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the bodie: we acknowledging him in the middle of our afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to be prone vnto mercie, might in all things ſhewe our ſelues patient: which is the force of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles reaſon, why in our afflictions we ſhould be patient; becauſe euen therein the Lord is mercifull, and inclined to pittie; correcting vs for our benefite, readie in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to deliuer and reſcue vs: and to ſende vs a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deliuerance out of all our miſeries, according to <note place="margin">

Thus both God, and the Patriarkes, Chriſt, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, is our example hereof, ſo that it cannot be a thing vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>Nowe if they replie: that it was lawfull in the time of the lawe, but not in the time of the Goſpel: that may eaſily bee refuted: for our Sauiour Chriſt diſanulled no <note place="margin">

And this is a part of the morall lawe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at Chriſtes comming, was it not abholiſhed, but ſtandeth in full ſtrength, power, and vertue for euer. Neither can their cauill impeach this doctrine: for that our Sauiour the ſetter foorth of the Goſpel: and <hi>Paul</hi> a faythfull preacher of the ſame, and both in the prime of the Goſpell, haue ſworne, wherehence it is apparant, that euen vnder the Goſpell, it was lawfull for Chriſtians to ſweare.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Laſtly, the lawfulnes of an othe, euen among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians herehence appeareth, in that the ende of othes is profitable, and the vſe neceſſarie among men. For whoſe vſe is profitable and good, and whoſe ende is needefull and neceſſarie: that muſt needes be good, profitable and lawfull. Such a thing is an othe taken in the feare of God.</p>
               <p>Some things are done in ſuch ſecrecie, and ſo priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that they cannot bee knowne, or come ro light, but onely by an othe: then men are forced to take an othe, and to witneſſe a truth in the name of God: the knowledge whereof is right neceſſarie among men. So in the lawe, when a man had laid a pawne, or any other thing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truſt to another: and the thing were loſt or miſcaried vnder <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. <hi>Num.</hi> 5. 19.</note> his hands: if the theefe were not founde, the receyuer ſhould be brought before the Iudge, and take his othe, whether hee had ſtole it, conueyed it away and embe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed it, or no. VVhereof ſeeing the owner had no wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he to whom it was committed and had receyned
<pb facs="tcp:19545:315"/> it, was put to his othe, whether it was gone by his meane and knowledge. Thus had this othe a neceſſarie ende and vſe among the people. VVhen the people of Iſrael were afflicted by the men of Ai, for the treſpaſſe and ſinne of <hi>Achan,</hi> in taking the execrable thing from Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioſua</hi> 7.</note> this thing beeing ſecrete and vnknowne: <hi>Ioſua</hi> commaunding all the tribes to appeare: and <hi>Achan</hi> at the length taken, <hi>Ioſua</hi> willeth him to ſweare, and to vtter the truth, which he did, and was puniſhid, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God againe obtained for his people. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to the Hebrewes commending lawfull othes vnto <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.</note> men, affirmeth, that an othe for confirmation among men, is the ende of all ſtrife. In euerie chriſtian common wealth, othes are for many ſuch cauſes taken: without which, as many ſinnes would lie ſecret and vnknowne, to the great hurt of men: ſo many duties would bee vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, were not men therunto bound by ſolemne othe, and proteſtation: the reuerend care whereof woorketh great good in the Church and common wealth, albeeit many moſt wickedly and vngodly, haue and doe deſpiſe the religion thereof. Seeing then the lawe it ſelfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth it, the example of God, the Patriarkes, Chriſt, and his Apoſtles confirmeth it: ſeeing the end is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the vſe profitable in the church &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealths of Chriſtians: what abſurditie is it in ſuperſticious Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, to condemne all othes, &amp; al ſwearings amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men?</p>
               <p>Othes then taken onely in the name of God for matters weightie, and of importance: righteous, iuſt, and true: to the glorie of God, the ending of controuerſies, the performance of duetie, the profite, peace. and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Church and common wealth: with pure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to truth, equitie and godlineſſe: with hatefull minds to falſhood, iniuries, wickednes, and oppreſſion: are lawfull in the Saints of God, and in true Chriſtians, euen vnder the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe things thus premiſed and ſet downe before, wherehence it appeareth that all othes are not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, neither euerie manner of ſwearing forbidden the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:19545:315"/> Saints of God: what manner of ſwearing doth the Lord in his law; our Sauiour in the Goſpell; and this Apoſtle in this place forbid and condemne?</p>
               <p>When the Lord in the lawe ſaid, thou ſhalt not take <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.</note> the name of the Lord thy god in vaine: it is apparant, that ſeeing in other places he permitted the Iſraelits to ſweare, therefore thereby he forbad not all ſwearing: but vaine ſwearing, falſe ſwearing, looſe and licencious, diſſolute and diſordered ſwering.</p>
               <p>For ſeeing that ſwering by the name of God, is a part of that diuine ſeruice, which is due vnto him, as in holy Scripture is apparant. Exo. 20. v. 7. c. 23. v. 13. Deut. 6. 13. v. cap. 10. ver. 20. Iſai. 65. 16. Ierem. 4. 2. 5. 7. ver. Iſai. 45. 23. c. 48. 1. Iere. 23. 7. 8. verſes. Pſal. 93. 11. v. Therefore woulde hee his people, to take diligent heede and beware that they runne not into anie ſuperſtition, irreligiouſneſſe, or impietie by vaine and wicked ſwearing: which euill to preuent, and that the religion of an othe might be inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, therefore the Lorde in his lawe commaunded that they ſhoulde not take his name in vaine, by raſh, vaine, wicked, and falſe ſwearing, or anie other way what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt in the Goſpell teacheth his: that they ſhould not ſweare at all: not forbidding ſuch <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.</note> othes as the law of God commendeth: but correcting &amp; controlling the diſorderedneſſe &amp; licenciouſnes of ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, which in his time was crept into the manners and mouthes of men, in whoſe time it was in cuſtom to ſweare by creatures; by heauen; earth; Hieruſalem the great Citie; by the Temple thereof, and ſuch like: as in the Goſpell appeareth. Which thing ſaith Saint <hi>Hillarie,</hi> they did in reproch of God, and to his diſhonour: who is then <note place="margin">

                  </note> highly diſhonoured, when his religion or anie poynt thereof is applied vnto creatures. This deteſtable wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe our Sauiour condemneth, willing that his ſhoulde not ſweare at all. And worthily doth Chriſt altogether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that wickedneſſe and vanitie of ſwearing, eſpecially by creatures: for it is plaine idolatrie, in as much as
<pb facs="tcp:19545:316"/> men make thoſe things their gods, whereby they ſweare. S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> writing vpon S. <hi>Matthew</hi> his goſpell, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">

Now to giue diuine worſhip to creatures, is idolatrie: therefore to ſweare by any thing then by God, is idolatrie. <hi>Lactantius</hi> reprouing <note place="margin">

If then thus to ſweare, be a thing ſo wicked, as our Sauiour rightwell conſidered, then no doubte our Sauiour had iuſt cauſe to forbid ſwearing altogether: yet not meaning all in generall, but all vaine, idolatrous and vvicked ſvvearing, vvhereunto that time vvas giuen.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Iames</hi> likewiſe, not forbidding or condemning all ſvvearing, but that ſvvearing which grew of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiencie vnder the croſſe: &amp; the diſorderednes of othes which was crept into their liues and manners, giueth this exhortation to the Saints: But aboue all things my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſvveare not, neyther by heauen, neyther by earth, neyther by any other othe condemning their vaine othes, their othes by creatures, their needleſſe othes in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate

               <p>If S. <hi>Iames</hi> and our Sauiour Chriſt alſo, forbad men to ſweare by heauen, earth, or any ſuch creature, or other whatſoeuer; &amp; wil, that raſh othes proceed not out of our mouthes: ſhall we then thinke it lawfull in vaine &amp; vpon euery occaſion raſhly to ſweare by him that ſitteth vpon the Cherubins, which walketh vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wings of the wind, and rideth vpon the heauens as an horſe? ſhall wee not ſweare by the earth, &amp; ſhall we thinke it lawfull to ſweare by the moſt pretious price of our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, paide by the only death &amp; bloud ſhedding of Ieſus Chriſt? ſhall we not ſweare, nether by heauen, nor by earth, nor any other oth; &amp; ſhal we think it lawful to ſweare by the creatour of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen &amp; earth? ſhall we thinke it lawfull to pearce the ſides, wound the hart, ſlay the ſoule, teare &amp; rent the body of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt by vaine ſwearing? All vaine othes therfore; all ſwearing by any creature, al ſwering in any maner, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the expreſſe word of God alloweth, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned.

               <p>And albeit we do not alwaies ſee the exequution of Gods iuſt iudgements againſt ſuch perſons: yet is it moſt ſure that thereby they fall into condemnation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the iuſte diſpleaſure of God: for which cauſe, as ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he puniſheth here, eyther in themſelues or in their

This eternall condemnation, and the intollerable wrath and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God for euer, if we will auoide and ſhunne: then muſt we hold faſt this exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that in common talke, in familiar and daylie communication and conference, in our ciuill dealings among men, we ſweare not at all: but that in all things our yea be yea, and nay be nay, leaſt we fall into condemnation.</p>
               <p>If then condemnation be here threatened againſt vaine and wicked ſwearers; and all men, of all ſtates and degrees; of all ſexe and kinde; men, women, young, olde, high, lowe, rich and poore, herein haue corrupted their waies: who daily ſlay the ſoule, wound the heart, pierce the ſides, rent the body of Ieſus Chriſt; and blaſpheme the holy name whereby they are called: are not all then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this condemnation?

If condemnation be threatened to the vaine ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of men, how much more ſubiect thereunto are they, which geue themſelues to horrible periuries, and falſe ſwearings? Which thing almightie God reſeruing finally to be puniſhed in eternall torments of hell fire: yet to ſhew how greatly hee deteſteth this wickednes, euen in this life, in ſome meaſure he puniſheth it. When <hi>Ioſua,</hi> &amp; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joſua</hi> 9.</note> the Princes of Iſrael had made a faithfull othe to the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites, <hi>Saul</hi> afterward violated it, almightie God in the <note place="margin">2. <hi>King:</hi> 21.</note> daies of <hi>Dauid,</hi> puniſhed it with three yeares famine tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row out Iſrael, till the ſeuen ſonnes of <hi>Saul</hi> were geuen
<pb facs="tcp:19545:319"/> to the Gibeonites to bee ſlaine. When <hi>Mataniah</hi> named by <hi>Nabuchodonoſour Zedichiah</hi> had ſworne ſubiection to the <note place="margin">4. <hi>Kings.</hi> 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.</note> King, but afterward forſwearing him ſealfe and rebelling: the Lorde puniſhed his periurie by the King of Babylon, who tooke him priſoner, ſlue his ſonnes before his eies, then put out both his eies, and caried him bounde into Babylon, where he was kept in perpetuall miſerie. I neede not ſay that therefore none of the poſteritie of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth came vnto the poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the crowne of England, becauſe he ſolemnely ſwore at Yorke, to holde him ſealfe contented with his owne duke dome, and to performe loyall obedience to the King. Duke <hi>Elphred</hi> conſpiring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt King <hi>Adelstane,</hi> for ſwore him ſealfe in his purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore at Rome, wherefore almightie God ſtroke him preſently in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> church there, and ſo hee died. Earle <hi>Godwine</hi> hauing treaterouſly ſlaine <hi>Alphrede</hi> brother to King <hi>Edward</hi> the third: thereof charged by the King at table at a certaine time, the Earle tooke breade in his hand and ſwore, deſiring that the bread might choake him, if he were there of giltie: which breade hee eating, was there with all ſodenly choaked, that hee fell downe and died. To be ſhorte, one may ſtande for many, which is notoriouſly knowen, that a woman which in the yeare 1575. for alittle flaxce forſwore her ſelfe in wood-ſtreate in London, therefore was preſently ſtroken and miſerably died with great torture, tormentes and terrour. Infinire like exampls of the iuſte iudgements of God in this behalfe are exſtant, and albeit God doe not alwaies, ſtrike all perſons in like manner offending, yet that it might appeare how greatly he deteſteth this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes, he giueth men a taſte of his anger and wrathfull indignation euen in this life preſent, ſhewing thereby how much more ſharpely they ſhalbe puniſhed in the world to come. And thought in great patience he beareth with this intollerable ſinne of men for a long time and ſeaſon: yet ſhall they not be vnpuniſhed for euer. Truely in this thing therefore ſaith the poet <hi>Tibullus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though that periurie be at the firſt couered: yet at length</hi>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:19545:319"/> 
                  <hi>puniſhment commeth without noyſe, ſecretely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Homer</hi> in like manner ſaith;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albeit God foorthwith puniſh not periuries, yet doeth hee at length: whereby moſt grieuous puniſhments falle on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, his companion, and children, which hath committed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which thing ſeemeth to haue beene fulfilled in <hi>Philip</hi> king of Macedonia his children: whom <hi>Pauſanias</hi> recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to haue fallen into ſo many miſeries, calamities and troubles, becauſe he violated his othes, and falſified his promiſes ſo often. Wherfore, howſoeuer either vain ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, or periured perſons, doe here eſcape the reuenging hand of God: yet ſhall they vndoubtedly be ſubiect to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall condemnation, vnleſſe they both leaue their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, and ſpeedely repent themſelues of their ſinne, &amp; embrace the councell of the Apoſtle; who correcteth this euil; Let your yea be yea, and your nay nay, leaſt ye fal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to condemnation.</p>
               <p>This reaſon drawen from danger, not temporal on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but eternal rather, might be a ſufficient ſtop and ſtay, to keep our lips from this wickednes: from which refraining we are ſo far, that we pretend excuſes to our vanity.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Some therefore ſay, I am forced to ſweare, men otherwiſe will not beleeue me. Shall man force thee to blaſpheme, and ſhal not Gods word drawe thee to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? ſhall man make thee to doe more in tranſgreſſing, then Gods word in obeying? Is there any neceſſitie to force thee to doe that, which doing, thou falleſt into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation? yea, is not thy owne vanitie, thy inconſtancie in thy words, thy falſhood in thy promiſes, thy periurie in thy othes, thy often ſwearing not vainly only, but vntrue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo, cauſe that no man giueth thee credit? if in al thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thy deedes were agreeable to thy words, &amp; thy performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces according to thy promiſes: if thou wert thy words ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and neuer proteſtedſt but the trueth: if thy tongue were geuen to ſimplicitie, and thy lippes not defiled with lies: then ſhoulde thy worde be beleeued as well, yea, rather better, then thine othe: but becauſe thy wordes are but wind, and in thy ſpeaches there is no hold: becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:19545:320"/> thy promiſes are without perfourmance, &amp; in thy ſaying there is no faith: becauſe in thy tongue there is no truſt, and in thy talke there is no trueth: therefore thou ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, yet thou art not beleeued. The law ſaith: He that is once preſuppoſed and taken for an euill man, is alwaies ſo preſuppoſed: and he that is taken once for faithleſſe &amp; vntruſtie, is alwaies ſo preſuppoſed. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (as <hi>Laertius</hi> writeth, or <hi>Demetrius,</hi> as other affirme) being asked what <note place="margin">Laertius de vitaphilo.</note> profite men gate by their lies, falſhoode, and vntrueths in them, anſwered; this onely, that oftentimes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they tell the trueth, yet men will not beleeue them. The fault therfore redoundeth vpon thy owne head, that thou art not beleeued: ſo farre therefore is this pretence from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing thy ſwearing, that it rather encreaſeth thy offence.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If we pretend our cuſtome, doeth this excuſe our ſinne? Nay, doeth not cuſtome of doing euill, aggrauate the wickednes? that ſeruant that is accuſtomed to rob his maſter, and doeth it therefore more commonly, is more puniſhable the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he that hath once done it, &amp; ſo hath done. The childe that by vſe and cuſtome groweth to be diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, deſerueth with more ſeueritie to be chaſtened, then he that once offendeth, and ſo leaueth. Euery wickednes how much more commonly it is done, ſo much more hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous is it. The man more accuſtomed to adulteries, is the more filthie whoremonger: the wife that hath more vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally proſtituted her ſelfe to others, is the more deteſtable harlot: the theefe that by cuſtome robbeth, deſerueth more iuſtly to be hanged: the more vſually any euill is committed, the more haynous and horrible is the ſinne, both before God and man. And ſhall we think it our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full excuſe? we haue got a cuſtome of ſwearing, &amp; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not leaue it, therefore we are to be excuſed. Things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that are receiued by cuſtome, being euil, are ſo much the worſe, how much more cuſtomable: and ought with ſo much greater care to be corrected, how much more wee are therewithall inured.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Neither can example of the multitude helpe vs, we doe but as all other men doe: we ſee ſuch men, &amp; ſuch
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:19545:320"/> women ſweare as deepely as we doe. This excuſeth not the fact: this deliuereth not from puniſhment. The more men ſinned in the ſinnes of the firſt world, the more was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 7.</note> Gods wrath kindled, and the heauier condemnation fell vpon them. The more vniuerſall and common the ſinnes of Sodom were, the lowder they cried to GOD for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. <note place="margin">

Let him pray. Is any merrie? let him ſing. Wherein we are taught what Chriſtians ſhould doe, and howe to behaue themſelues in all the chaunges and chaunces of this life: whether they taſte of the bitter cuppe of afflictions, or elſe bee partakers of the pleaſantneſſe of proſperitie: whether
<pb facs="tcp:19545:322"/> they bee in wo, or whether they bee in wealth: in both which ſtates and conditions of our life, our recourſe muſt bee to God: in affliction, by petition: in ioy and mirth, by thankes giuing, the other part of prayer. So that praier is profitable, and hath it place both in ſorrowe and in ioy: both in mourning and in mirth, which thing Saint <hi>James</hi> to inſinuate and ſignifie to vs, ſayth: is any man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you afflicted?

It behooueth vs therefore according to this
<pb facs="tcp:19545:323"/> admonition of the Apoſtle, according to the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, and the precept of his onely ſonne our Sauiour Chriſt, in our afflictions to ſolicite him with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant prayer: who knoweth howe to deliuer his out of temptations, &amp; to reſerue the wicked to the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> to be puniſhed. To him in our neceſſities and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries muſt we haue recourſe, whoſe eies are ouer the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp; his eares open vnto their praiers, and ſo deliuereth them out of all their troubles. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore whenſoeuer any of the ſaints be afflicted, whenſoeuer they be tried with any temptations: when they feele any perill or daunger immenent and at hand: whenſoeuer they are preſſed with any miſfortune, and caſt downe by any aduerſitie: their onely remedie muſt bee praier, and thereby to drawe neare vnto God: of whom they muſt earneſtly deſire, pacience in trouble, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie in affliction; ſtrength in miſerie; comfort in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe; deliuerance in calamitie; riddance out of tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſhall ſeeme beſt to his diuine maieſtie. Thus did the renowmed patriarkes: thus did the godly princes: thus did the holy prophets: thus did the bleſſed apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: thus did the conſtant martyrs: thus did all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of God: thus muſt all the Saints of God in their affliction doe: that they may practiſe the precept of the Apoſtle: Is any among you afflicted? let him pray.</p>
               <p>As here we are exhorted in affliction to pray: ſo doe afflictions mightily ſtirre vppe the Saintes of God to pray: ſo that they which oftentimes greatly forget God in their flouriſhing wealth, in their abounding proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, in their plentifull condition, in their continued health; in their affliction, aduerſitie, and miſerie: flie to him by praier, and ſeeke him with their whole hearts. VVhich is not the leaſt profite redounding vnto the Saintes by affliction. For men in proſperitie often for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of GOD, colde in zeale, ſlacke in prayer, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in duetie; their loynes weakened and preſſed with a heauie weight and burthen of troubles: and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the fire and water of affliction, runne ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:19545:323"/> by prayer to God for ſuccour, as the Scriptures of God, and examples of the Saintes teach vs. VVhen the Prophete had denounced calamitie and miſerie agaynſt <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai</hi> 17.</note> Damaſcus, and Ephraim, and tolde the people what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ſhoulde befall them: ſhewing the effect and worke which afflictions cauſe in the Saintes eſpecially, euen to force vs to God, and make vs by prayer to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelues vnto him, ſayeth; At that day ſhall a man looke to his maker, and his eies ſhall bee to the holy one of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>In another place anſwerable and correſpondent is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai</hi> 26.</note> the ſaying of the ſame Prophete hereunto: Lord, ſayeth the Prophete, in trouble haue they viſited thee, they powred out their prayers, when thy chaſtiſement was vppon them. <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe, a man according to the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.</note> minde of GOD, at other times not vnmindfull of God: yet when hee was afflicted by his enemies, was more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſtirred vp to prayer: therefore hee ſayeth of himſelfe; when I was in trouble, I called vppon God, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.</note> and hee heard me. And rehearſing the ſtorie of Iſrael, who in their welfare were rebellious, and forgetfull, but by aduerſitie were drawen vnto God through prayer, affirmeth that when God puniſhed them, and any wiſe afflicted them, then they returned vnto him by prayer. And the bookes of Ioſua, Iudges, and the firſt of Samuel, eſpecially, ſhewe howe effectually their calamities and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioſua, Iudges,</hi> 1. <hi>Samuel. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> afflictions moued them by prayer to haue recourſe to God: inſomuch as it appeareth, when by their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie they were puffed vp: yet when they were eyther ſmitten with the ſworde of their enemies, or pinched with penurie and want: or diſtreſſed with famine: or perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by grieuous peſtilence from God: or any wiſe by him afflicted, then they by prayer returned vnto the Lorde. And this experience in our owne ſelues aboundantly teacheth vs: who in our afflictions, if euer, haue our recourſe by prayer vnto God. This is therefore in all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions the beſt remedy, to flie vnto God by praier, which hath place both in aduerſitie, and in proſperitie, both
<pb facs="tcp:19545:324"/> in mourning and in mirth, both in ſorovve and in ioye, whereof the Apoſtle in this place aſſureth vs, is any amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g you afflicted? let him pray.</p>
               <p>And to teach vs that prayer is profitable alſo in ioye: therefore Saint <hi>Iames</hi> addeth; is any among you merie? Let him ſing. As in our afflictions we muſt not ſnoffe, fret, or fume; ſo in proſperitie muſt vve not vvaxe vvanton, riottous, forgetfull of duetie; nor ſwell, or be pufte vp vvith pride and vaine confidence of our flouriſhing ſtate, which is both vncertaine and variable: but we muſt ſing Pſalmes of prayſe and thankeſgiuing vnto God, by whoſe meanes, and at vvhoſe hands, vve receyue all good things: to him therefore muſt we offerre a ſacrifice of prayſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the fruite of our lippes confeſſing his name: leaſt <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.</note> vve abuſe his benefits to his contempt and diſhonour; whereof the Apoſtle admoniſheth in this place: is any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you merie? let him ſing.</p>
               <p>Novv that the Apoſtle here ſaith, is any among you afflicted? let him pray: is any merie? let him ſing: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence ſome thinke that men in affliction may not ſing, neyther can praie ſinging: therefore condemne they in vs the ſinging of the Lordes prayer: becauſe Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> ſay they, willeth if we be afflicted, that then vvee ſhould pray and not ſing: but if vvee be merie, then to ſing: So that the Apoſtle ſeemeth to make prayer and ſinging, oppoſite and contrarie; as if prayer in affliction onely, and ſinging in mirth and proſperitie alone, were to bee vſed.</p>
               <p>To this I may anſwere in this wiſe. 1. That <hi>James</hi> doth not oppoſe prayer and ſinging as ſo contrarie, as that no man can pray ſinging, nor ſing praying: for vvee ſee in the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> which are both ſonges, and alſo moſt earneſt praiers, that he ſong them, and plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto vvith ſundrie inſtrumentes, and yet at once prayed thereby moſt earneſtly to God; &amp; had oftentimes vnder a ſweete ſounde, a wofull and heauie heart: as when he vvas perſequuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> who could more earneſtly haue prayed, then he doth in his fourth Pſalme: vvherein <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.</note>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:19545:324"/> he moſt feruently deſireth ſuccour againſt his enemies? yet was that committed to him that excelled, and was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ſet the tune and begin the Pſalmes, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun that Pſalme vpon the inſtrument called Neginoth, or he ſonge it to a tune ſo called.</p>
               <p>Who coulde or can praie more hartily then <hi>Dauid</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.</note> did, beyng reproued by <hi>Nathan</hi> for his adulterie and murther? yet vvas that Pſalme to be ſonge and begonne by him that vvas moſt excellent among them that vvere appointed to ſing the Pſalmes, and to plaie vpon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes: and to this purpoſe ſhall you reade almoſt before euery Pſalme; to him that excelleth, a Pſalme of <hi>Dauid:</hi> that is; a Pſalme of <hi>Dauid</hi> to be ſonge and begon by him that among the reſte excelled in muſike and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on inſtruments.</p>
               <p>In like manner vvhen he vvas ſore vexed by the falſe reportes of <hi>Saules</hi> flatterers, he made that wofull and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.</note> ſonge; vvhen I vvas in trouble, I called vpon the Lord and he heard me, &amp;c. And it is called a ſong of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; that is in riſing and falling: of lifting vp the tune, and falling vvith the voice in ſinging: and more the like, in that Ptophete may be ſeene.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let vs know that Pſalmes and ſonges are of tvvo ſortes: there are ſome ſonges and pſalmes full of lamentable and woful heauines, which are ſong with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy and relenting hearts, as many of the pſalmes of <hi>Dauid</hi> were: ſome which are of ioy &amp; gladnes; they, at our ſuites in our troubles; ſuing for pardon of ſinne; ſeeking for the wonted fauour of God; deſiring eaſe and releaſe in miſery; praying for riddaunce out of afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are vſed: but theſe, are our Pſalmes and ſonges of prayſe and thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, for the benefites and bleſſinges vvee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>James,</hi> in this place teacheth vs, when we are in great diſtreſſe and extreame anguiſh of our hearts for our affliction, wherewith we are preſſed, ſo that for the preſent we cannot but be heauy: to flie to God by praier, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelues thereby before him, and of him onely to
<pb facs="tcp:19545:325"/> ſeeke ſuccour and ſafegard in all our miſeries: as the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt remedie, and moſt commonly in greateſt affliction to be vſed. Not leauing this as a rule in all afflictions: for in ſome, and ſometimes it is alſo lawfull to powre out our hearts in pſalmes &amp; ſonges to the Lord: but for aſmuch as in greateſt anguiſh and griefe for afflictions, our harts are ſo heauie, that our voices are vnfit to ſing: the Apoſtle in ſuch would, that then we ſhould pray; is any among you afflicted? let him praie.</p>
               <p>In like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, when we are in proſperitie, and enioy the bleſſings of God at our willes, and in large ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, that therefore our hearts are light and merie, in which caſe commonly we giue our ſelues to ſinging: the Apoſtle willeth vs that when in our mirth we will ſing; that then we ſhould ſinge Pſalmes and ſonges of prayſe, not other ſonges, vaine, light, and wicked, as worldlings doo, who in their mirth ſing bawdie ballets and ſonnets full of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie ribauldrie: not making this a rule which cannot be broken; for it is lavvfull euen in proſperitie, in feruent prayer to mourne, to lament, to ſigh, to ſobbe before the Lord. So then, as in affliction he forbiddeth not lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, wofull and ſorowfull ſinging; ſo neither in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and wealth, in mitth and reioycing, interdicteth he, ſadde, heauie, and groning praier: but ſheweth that where as in great affliction, the vvicked either fall into diſpaire, or breake out into blaſphemie, or ſeeke vnlawful meanes of deliueraunce: therein the ſaints ſhould be take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to prayer: and when in proſperitie, mirth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing, vvorldlinges ſinge filthie ſonges and ſonnets; the ſaints of God diſpoſed to ſinge, ſhould ſinge ſonges of praiſe and thankeſgiuing vnto God. And ſo prayer here may be appoſed to diſpaire, blaſphemie, ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter euill meanes: and ſinging may be oppoſed to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt mirth, the diſordered ioye, the vvanton and filthie reioycing of the wicked.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may thus anſwere: that Saint <hi>James</hi> by praier here meaneth requeſt or petition; by ſinging, not the lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp and falling downe of the voice and tune, as is in
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:19545:325"/> muſicall ſonges; but a plaine thankes giuing to God.

               <p>Novv if vvee take ſinging in that ſence vvherein it is commonly taken, for the riſing and falling of the tune: for the lifting vp and depreſsing of the voice, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of tunes and meaſures in our ſinging; it may here be demaunded vvhat ſinging becommeth the ſaints of God.</p>
               <p>Touching the matter of their ſonges, the thinges they muſt ſing; muſt be the praiſes of God, giuing thanks <note place="margin">What ſinging is lawfull.</note> vnto him for his bleſsings beſtovved vpon vs: which is the matter here by the Apoſtle me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, though ſometimes our godly ſonges may containe ſome other argument, as the ſongs &amp; Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid</hi> vvere for ſundry purpoſes, and of manifold matters. Yet here I ſay, S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh of ſinging praiſes vnto God.</p>
               <p>Concerning the manner how we muſt ſing: though curious and deuided muſike, in our priuate houſes, &amp; for the exerciſe of our skill, for the attaining to perfection of that arte, cannot be condemned: yet in our ſonges and exerciſes to GOD, moſte chiefely in the face of the church, and in the middle of the holy congregation, vve muſt ſing in moſt plaine and modeſt manner, and ſo as ſhall ſerue beſte for edification; that vvee haue regarde, not ſo much to the ſound, as to the ſenſe of that which is ſonge.</p>
               <p>Singing in the beſt times and among the moſt holy
<pb facs="tcp:19545:326"/> men of God, hath had, and now may alſo haue three ends, or opportunities when and wherein it is lawfull and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to ſing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To recreate our heauie and ſorowfull heartes with ſome holy and godly ſonge and Pſalme. The prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> oftentimes in the ſorow and heauineſſe of his heart, ſong to ſolace &amp; recreate his ſorovvfull ſpirite before God. Chriſtians in like manner, in the anguiſh of their ſpirites: the troubles of their hearts, the vexations of their mindes, the griefes of their ſoules, may ſing for their godly recreation, ſonges and Pſalmes vnto God, that thereby they may be lightened, and comforted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another ende, vſe and occaſion of ſinging, is the teſtifying of our thankefulnes vnto God for his immea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable mercies, bountifull benefits, gratious goodnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs. Wherin <hi>Miriah</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Moſes,</hi> with the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels <note place="margin">

               <p>When <hi>Barak</hi> by the counſell and pricking on of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah,</hi> had armed the people againſt <hi>Siſera</hi> the captaine of <note place="margin">

               <p> 
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> being marueilouſlie preſerued from his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite enemies, and at the length by the mightie power of <note place="margin">

               <p>When almightie God had heard the humble ſuite <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kings</hi> 2.</note> of <hi>Anna,</hi> the mother of <hi>Samuel,</hi> who being barren, deſired that ſhe might haue a childe: &amp; at her requeſt he had geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her <hi>Samuel</hi> her ſonne: to teſtifie her thankfulnes to God for the ſame, ſong a ſong of praiſe therefore vnto GOD. When the Lord had looked to the humilitie of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin, and made her the veſſell of Chriſtes concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for that bleſſing ſhe brake out, and ſang; My ſoule <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> in like manner, the one after the birth of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt his ſonne: the other after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued <note place="margin">

Whereby, and by the like examples it is not only lawful, but laudable alſo in the Saints of God, either for benefites &amp; bleſſings, either of victory againſt our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; or of deliuerance out of trouble: or for the fruits of the earth receaued in due ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; or for what thing ſoeuer we haue mercifullie receaued at his hand, to ſing to God, and ſo be thankful.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The third vſe and ende of ſinging, is to aduaunce thereby the glorie of God, to ſtirre vp men to zeale to his worde, feruencie in praier, and earneſtnes of perfourming all laudable ſeruice vnto him. Whereunto the example of <hi>Elizeus</hi> may be referred, who at the requeſt of <hi>Iehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> prouoked himſelfe by all meanes forwarde, more earneſtly to pray to God, and to praiſe him for his <note place="margin">

               <p>Thus by all poſſible meanes; as by playing vpon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and by ſinging, the Prophet ſtirreth vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the aduaunancement of Gods glorie. And to this ende he brought in ſundrie inſtruments of muſick, diuine kindes of ſongs and pſalmes, varietie of tunes and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies into the church of God.</p>
               <p>The old Hebrewes toke vp and ſet downe the arke of God with ſinging: this was vſed in the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.

                  </note> who both auouch of them, that they roſe vp early to ſing: ſongs and pſalmes to God.</p>

And this was in ſuch moderation, as that the note carried not away, nor <note place="margin">

                  </note> confounded the dittie: neither the ſound, the ſence of the thing.</p>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:19545:327"/>
               <p> Whereof Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> being afraide, deſired the vſe of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in the Church of Alexandria, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Reader to ſtande and ſing, with ſo little inflection <note place="margin">

               <p>Such like ſinging therefore, whether it bee in our priuate houſes; or whether it be in the face of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, is commendable. And this is the kinde of ſinging in our exerciſes to God, whether they be priuate, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, that may be iuſtified.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Iames</hi> requireth in our priuate gratulations, and thankſgeuing for benefites to almightie God, that we ſhould in this wiſe ſing; Is any merrie? let him ſing. To ſing therefore in the modeſtie and moderation of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, in the manifolde ioyes and bleſſinges of this life, in token of our thankefull hearts to GOD, for the bleſſinges and benefits from him ſo plentifully receaued, is here commended by the Apoſtle; Is any man mery? let him ſing.</p>
               <p>In the generall afflictions therefore of our life; the beſt remedie is praier, here by Saint <hi>Iames</hi> preſcribed: whereof there is vſe, both in ſorow and in ioy; in aduerſitie and proſperitie, according to the doctrine here deliuered; Is any among you afflicted? let him pray: is any merry, let him ſing. Thus are we here taught generally, when we are either moued by affliction, or merrie in minde, by occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods bleſſings, what to doe: which is the firſt parte of this treatiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As men in their afflictions generally are here <note place="margin">Remedie in particular affliction of Sickenes.</note> taught, to commend their cauſes and caſes to GOD by praier: ſo in the next &amp; ſecond place, he teacheth vs what particularly in ſicknes we ſhould doe: ſhewing to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie we muſt runne; to what Phyſicion we muſt ſeeke to, in our extremitie of ſicknes, a particular affliction: wherof thus ſaith Saint <hi>Iames;</hi> Is any ſicke among you? Let him ſende for the Elders of the Church, and let them praie for him, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19545:328"/>
               <p> The elders of the Church muſt be our chiefe Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions: <note place="margin">

               <p>By Elders here are vnderſtoode the graue, godlie, wiſe and diſcreete brethren, they chiefly of the miniſterie, as moſt conuenient it ſhoulde be; as vnto whom this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gift and power was geuen: with other of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as oftentimes iuſt occaſion ſerued for them: and ſo often both together, as was moſt profitable: ſuch as were able in errour to inſtruct; in griefe to comfort; in ſorowe to ſolace, and in ſicknes to aduiſe the patient. To them, not to ſorcerers, inchaunters, witches, wiſe-wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or wiſe men, are we commanded by Saint <hi>James</hi> in our ſicknes to flie.</p>
               <p>To the Saints and Elders of the Church, in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time, was the gift of healing ſicknes, and bodilie infirmities geuen, according as our Sauiour Chriſt had promiſed his Diſciples: whom ſending foorth, Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth them from the effect their preaching ſhoulde <note place="margin">

And theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens ſhall followe them which beleeue; In my name they ſhall caſt out deuils, and ſhall ſpeake with new tongues, and they ſhall take away ſerpents, and if they ſhall drinke any deadly thing, it ſhall not hurte them: they ſhall lay their hands on the ſicke, and they ſhall recouer. This gift was therefore promiſed the faithfull, and the brethren, in the ſecond ſending foorth of the Apoſtles into the world. Of which gift the Apoſtles in their firſt ſending out, were partakers. Therefore Saint <hi>Marke</hi> thereof ſpeaking, ſaith; They caſt out many deuils, and annointed many that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marke</hi> 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 8.</note> were ſicke, and they were healed. The Apoſtle S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh of this matter as it was in his time, wherein the Saints and brethren had the gift of healing. Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:19545:328"/> reckoning vp the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, in his time pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out vpon the Church, mentioneth there-among, the gift of healing; To one is geuen the word of wiſdome, to <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</note> another is geuen the word of knowledge by the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, to another is geuen faith by the ſame ſpirite, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the gift of healing, by the ſame ſpirite.</p>
               <p>The ſigne of this gift of healing, was annointing with oile, in the name of the Lord: therefore Saint <hi>Iames</hi> here exhorteth, that the Elders of the Church be ſent for: that they pray, that they annoint the ſicke in the name of the Lord. Whileſt then the gift of healing, being but a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall gift, to continue for a ſeaſon, was in the church: ſo long the ſigne thereof, which was annointing with oile, continued: the gift ſhortly after the apoſtles time ceaſing, the ſigne ceaſed alſo.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, our aduerſaries the Papiſts, by an apiſh and eluiſh imitation of the Apoſtles, contrarie to their meaning, retaine the ſigne, the thing ceaſing: And albeit healing be taken from the Church, yet doe they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint ſtill, which alſo they make a Sacrament, and call it extreame vnction: which they miniſter to the ſick, not in ſigne of health and recouerie, as the Apoſtles did: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is no hope of life in them, then annointe they men and women, as a goodly remedie and helpe againſt ſinne, ſatan, death and damnation.</p>
               <p>Whoſe erronious opinion hath no ſure foundation, no certaine ground, no true eſtabliſhment in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And for thoſe places which they vſe, and alleadge for the ſame, they helpe no whit at all. Where they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge out of <hi>Marke,</hi> that the Apoſtles did annoint with oile, and ſo healed, it is true. Let them therence reaſon, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marke</hi> 6.</note> and their reaſon is abſurd. The Apoſtles annointed ſuch as were thereby healed: therefore we will vſe to annoint ſuch as are readie to die. What ſequence or following is there in this reaſon? The Apoſtles did it to ſuch as reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered; they doe it to none but ſuch as they geue ouer to death, and haue no hope of their life. The Apoſtles did it in token of health, they doe it as a ſure aide againſt ſatan,
<pb facs="tcp:19545:329"/> ſinne, death and damnation, holding that who ſo in that extremitie is ſo annoynted, ſhalbe out of danger of Satan and death. This continued but for a time, and theſe men would haue it to remain as a ſacrament for euer. How can it be grownded then vppon the Euangeliſts doctrine? The Apoſtles themſelues did not alwaies neceſſarily vſe that ſigne in healing: but ſometimes the word and prayer on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: ſomtimes laying on of hands only: ſometimes touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 40. <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 10 <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 15</note> only, ſometime lying vpon, as in the Actes of the holie Apoſtles in ſundrie places appeareth. Sometimes the verie ſhadowe of the Apoſtles ſerued, as the ſhadowe of <hi>Peter</hi> healed many: ſometimes things brought from them, and giuen to the ſicke, as from <hi>Paul</hi> were brought vnto the ſicke, kercheifs and hand kercheifs, and deceaſes were taken from them, and foule ſpirites departed. So <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 19</note> then it was no ſuch ſacrament in the dayes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>
               <p>Neither doth this place any whitte helpe or profit them. For heere annoynting is a ſigne of health and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie, the gifte therof ſeaſing, the ſigne muſt ceaſe alſo, neither ment <hi>James,</hi> that it ſhould be vſed as a ſalue of a ſurgeon: or as a medicine of the phyſition, but that in ſickenes they lifting vp their minds to God: and powring out their prayers to him, might receaue that in ſigne, that as their bodies by that externall meane ſhould bee healed, ſo their ſouls ſhould be clenged, purged, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the holy annoynting of the ſpirite of God, and of Ieſus Chriſt. So that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not of their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramente, which thing euen Cardinall <hi>Caietane</hi> their <note place="margin">Caietane.</note> owne man confeſſeth in like manner.</p>
               <p>The Apoſte in this place ſpeaketh according as the gifte of healing was in force in his time: and binding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men thereunto, during the time of the continuance of the ſame, and not for euer as the papiſts doe.</p>
               <p>Out of which place we may learne thus much, that as when in the Apoſtles time the gifte of healing was in force, men were willed to ſende for the Elders of the Church, that they might pray for the ſicke, and annoint
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:19545:329"/> them with oile, that they might recouer: So nowe (the gift being taken away) in our great and extreame ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſend for the elders of the Church, the Paſtours, the Miniſters, the preachers of the worde: with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full brethren: that by them we may be taught, that the cauſe of our ſickeneſſe is our ſinne: that they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme vs in the doctrine of vnfained repentance: that they may comfort and counſell vs in our extremities: that they may powre out praiers vnto God for the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his grace, and encreaſe of all needfull ſpirituall vertues in vs: and for riddance out of our paines and ſickeneſſe, as ſhall ſeeme beſt to his heauenly wiſedome. VVhich done, we may vſe all other lawful meanes of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, or the like for our recouerie, in the feare of God.</p>
               <p>But now is it quite contrarie with moſt men: for, as if ſickeneſſe befell men, rather by chaunce and fortune, then by the prouidence of God: and by naturall cauſes onely, and not as puniſhments of ſinne, chaſtiſements of men in this world from the hand of God, or as trials of our pacience, and exerciſes of our faith: in their bodily diſeaſes, they foorthwith flie to outward remedies: ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they haue more care of the life of their bodies, then of the ſaluation of their ſoules. They poſte to the Phyſition: they ſende in all haſte to the Apoticarie: they runne to the Surgeon: they greedily ſeeke after all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde meanes: but their hearts are not turned to God, who ſendeth death, and giueth life: who woundeth and maketh whole: bringeth to graue, and lifteth vp againe: they ſearch not out the true cauſe of their ſicknes which is their ſin: But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaueth, hearing ceaſeth, ſpeach faileth, ſenſes are gone, and the partie more then halfe deade: then doe moſt ſende for the miniſter, runne for the Paſtour: ſeeke to the preacher, when he can not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite the ſicke perſon. VVhat counſell can nowe bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? what inſtruction can nowe be taken? what comfort can now be miniſtred? what exhortation can preuaile in this extremitie? This ought not to be ſo my brethren: it is
<pb facs="tcp:19545:330"/> not the meaning of the Apoſtle, whoſe counſell is rather that in all our bodily diſeaſes, we ſhould flie firſt to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and ghoſtly phyſitions, as appeareth. Wherefore in this place the Apoſtle willeth, that if anie be ſicke, they ſhould call for the elders of the Church, that they might pray for them,</p>
               <p>VVhoſe prayers in that behalfe of what force they be, the Apoſtle expreſſeth: &amp; the praier of the faithful ſhal ſaue the ſicke, and the Lorde ſhall raiſe him vp: and if he haue committed ſinne, it ſhall be forgiuen him.</p>
               <p>Which place teacheth, that healing in that time was not to be aſcribed and aſſigned to the annoiting with oile: but to the praiers of the Elders flowing from faith: and the praier of the faith ſhall ſaue him, ſaieth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. The praier of faith, proceeding from a ſtedfaſt hope, an vndoubted truſt, an earneſt beliefe, is therfore of great force. For God is neare at hande to heare all ſuch as call <note place="margin">

               <p>Prayer is the effectuall inſtrument, and meane to the obtaining of health, which to that effect God would to bee vſed. Therefore when the holy Prophets or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtles, reſtored life to the dead, ſight to the blind, limmes to the lame, health to the ſicke, hearing to the deafe, ſpeach to the dumme, or the like: they haue vſed praier thereunto. <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, reſtoring the ſonne of the widowe of Sareptha being deade, to health, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">3. <hi>Kings</hi> 17.</note> to life it ſelfe: ſtretched himſelfe vppon him, and called vppon the name of the Lorde.

               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:19545:330"/>
               <p> When <hi>Peter</hi> reſtored <hi>Tabitha</hi> to life, hee kneeled <note place="margin">

And in other cures, both our Sauiour himſelfe, and the Apoſtles vſed prayer.</p>
               <p>VVhich is the meane and inſtrument of healing, here by the Apoſtle ſette downe: the efficient cauſe whereof is God himſelfe: therefore hee ſayeth; And God ſhall raiſe him vppe: and if hee hath committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinne, it ſhall bee forgiuen him.

               <p>Another effect of praier is, that through the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full praiers of the Saints, their ſinnes are forgiuen the ſicke. If, ſaith Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> hee hath committed ſinne, it ſhall be forgiuen him. Where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

Wherefore to this purpoſe, as in ſicknes he willed that the Elders of the church ſhould be ſent for, and aſſembled to praie for the ſicke: ſo a ſecond remedie and helpe in ſicknes is, that the brethren thus aſſembled, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre mutually touching offences committed, that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually confeſſing, and mutually forgiuing, God might the better heare their mutuall praiers of loue, for thoſe which were ſicke among them. To which purpoſe this place ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: acknowledge your faultes one to another: open that which grieueth you, that a remedy may be ſought and found out for it, the better.</p>
               <p>This mutuall confeſsion and acknowledging one to another, wherein one of vs hath offended another, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred word of God, &amp; the holy Scriptures co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend vnto vs. To which ende our Sauiour Chriſt exhorteth the Saints, that when they come to offer any gift vpon the altar, and <note place="margin">

               <p> Saint <hi>James</hi> in this place, either for mutuall comfort which they might receyue one of another by acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their faultes: or for mutuall reconciliation, which in ſickneſſe is requiſite; exhorteth the ſaints to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their faultes one to another: which thing is moſt expedient: for it is not expedient, that ſuch as haue giuen offence, ſhould acknowledge the offence done, thereby to ſatisfie for the treſpaſſe committed, to entertaine peace, vnitie, loue, and charitie among themſelues? to liue and loue together as brethren? And for aſmuch as wee here eyther not at all, or very hardly liue without offence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnto others, is it not very neceſſarie for the ſaluing vp of all matters, that wee mutually confeſſe offences, mutually be reconciled, and mutually forgiue one the other?</p>
               <p>And this acknowledging of our offences and faults, this confeſsion, is of priuate offences done by one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: which as at other times is needefull, ſo in our ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is neceſſarie: that we being in perfect loue and peace with all men: may eyther thereby finde releaſe of paine the ſooner, or els with more quiet mindes ſleepe in euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting reſt and quietneſſe, when we ſhalbe diſſolued out of theſe our mortall bodies.</p>

How know they when they heare of me, of my ſelfe, whether I <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</note> ſpeake the truth, ſith no man knoweth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what is done in man, but the ſpirite of man that is in him?</p>
               <p>This intollerable arrogancie of men to heare the confeſsions of other mens ſinnes, <hi>Lyſander</hi> could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide; wherefore when he asked counſell in Samothracia <note place="margin">Lyſander.</note> of the Oracle: being willed by the prieſt and keeper thereof, to tell the greateſt ſinne that euer he committed: asked whether he ſhould do it at his bidding, or at the commaundement of the gods. When it was tolde hm, it was the commaundement of the gods: he willed the prieſt to ſtande a parte, and he would tell it the gods, if they did aske him. Thus the very heathen deteſted this auricular confeſsion of their ſinnes vnto others. Wherefore let that be abandoned farre from the ſchoole of Chriſt, which the very heathen by reaſon did not admit, and let it be condemned for euer, as an errour or hereſie not tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which neyther Scripture confirmeth, nor Fathers allow of.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>James</hi> in this place ſpeaketh nothing hereof, but only of confeſsion of offences priuately committed, which either for mutuall comfort, or for mutuall reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, ought to be mutually confeſſed, as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> &amp; <hi>Bede</hi> expound it. Vnto which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſsion, mutual praier is ioined: wherof albeit in the 14. &amp; 15. verſes he had ſpoken, yet to ſhew the excellencie and neceſsitie thereof, here repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it againe &amp; requireth it. Which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth from the effect: that all men might ſee and know, that there is nothing more effectuall and forceble to the healing of our bodily diſeaſes, then vnfained praier, proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:19545:334"/> a liuelie faith, a pure heart, and good conſcience to God. Which effect of mutuall confeſſion and praier, is health: acknowledge your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed: our mindes cleere of malice; our hearts of hatred; our affections of enuie; our deſires of wrath and reuenge: our bodies ſhall the ſooner be reſtored to health by the Lord.</p>
               <p>Seeing then ſuch an effect followeth mutuall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, we ought to be councelled by the holy Ghoſt, and aduiſed by the Apoſtle to praie one for another; that wee may be healed. But of this more hath beene ſpoken vpon the 14. and 15. verſes before going.</p>
               <p>Where Saint <hi>Iames</hi> exhorteth vs to pray one for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, it no whitte at all fauoureth the opinion of Popiſh perſons, either for their praiers to the dead; or for the dead. To the deceaſed Saints, herence are we not moued to pray, as to mediatours and aduocates for vs to God. For here the Apoſtle (as before) deſireth the liuing ſaints to pray one for another, that they may be healed. The Lords prayer teacheth, that men aliue may pray for men liuing; therefore therein we pray not for our ſelues alone, but for the whole bodie of the Church. One man may ſue to God for another being aliue, and we are willed to ſeeke for the praiers of the liuing Saints, that they may be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out for vs to God. But to ſue for the helpe of the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ſoules, and ſpirites of men and women decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: neither doeth this place, neither any other in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Scriptures of God, teach or perſwade vs.</p>
               <p>And as we are not taught to ſue to the dead: ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we taught to ſue for the dead: for the liuing ſaints muſt pray one for another being aliue: they are willed to praie for thoſe that are ſicke, but not dead. <hi>Dauid</hi> praied <note place="margin">2. <hi>Kings</hi> 12.</note> for the childe begotten of <hi>Berſebah,</hi> when it was ſicke: but aſſoone as it was dead, he ceaſed. <hi>Abraham</hi> praied for the <note place="margin">

               <p>Now that health followeth the praiers of Gods ſaints, we muſt not take it, that as all they for whom praier was made, were alwaies healed in the time of the Apoſtles: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo alſo now: but that as in that time, it was the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie meane, and had his effect in all: euen ſo ought it to be a meane now, and no doubt in ſundrie it ſhalbe, and is aſſuredly very effectuall, (though the gift of healing be not as it was in the time of the Apoſtles;) for GOD will heare the praiers of his ſeruants, and will fulfill their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: whoſe eares are open to the ſuites of the righteous, and will graunt their requeſts, as ſhall ſtand beſt with his heauenly wiſdome.</p>
               <p>This effect oftentimes to followe the praiers of the Saints, it is ſhewed, for that the praiers of the righteous are very forcible, and preuaile much, if they be feruent. Of the force of the Saints praiers, ſee Sermon 2. vpon S. <hi>Iames,</hi> leafe 19. 1. page, &amp;c. Sermon 3. leafe 26. page 1. &amp;c.

               <p n="1">1 Touching him that praieth, if he wil haue his praier heard, he muſt be iuſt and righteous: for it is here ſaide; that the praier of the righteous auaileth much. They muſt be ſuch as feare God, and beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt: ſuch as are carefull to ſerue him in ſpirite and trueth: ſuch as doe walke before him in holines and righteouſneſſe of life. Theſe are they, whoſe praiers auaile much.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:19545:335"/> promiſeth the preſent helpe, and the prieſt aide of god to our praiers, when we are righteous: the eyes of the Lord are ouer the righteous, and his eares are open to their praiers. The praiers of the righteous pearce euen <note place="margin">

               <p>Though then there be infinite diſtance betwixt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, God and man: yet heareth he from his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hill, the praiers of his righteous ſeruantes, poured out vnto him.</p>

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.</note> wife the king had taken away) was a Prophet, &amp; he ſhould praie for him: who praying, the people and Prince, were healed of their diſeaſe, wherewith God (for <hi>Sarah)</hi> had plagued them. To which purpoſe, to ſhew of what weight the praiers of Gods Saints are with him, he commaunded the three frends of <hi>Iob</hi> to goe and be reconciled vnto <hi>Iob,</hi>

               <p>All which teacheth, that onely their prayers are of force with God for good, who are iuſt and righteous. The praier (ſaith Saint <hi>Iames)</hi> of the righteous preuaileth much.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19545:336"/>
               <p> As in him that praieth it is required, that he be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: ſo is it required in the praier of the righteous, that it be alſo feruent, proceeding from a pure affection, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from vnfeined faith, kindled by a burning zeale, influ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med with feruent loue, continued in great earneſtneſſe and conſtancie: without which our praiers obteine little or nothing at the hands of God; but being earneſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and feruent, they preuaile greatly.

Our Sauiour Chriſt teacheth by two places in Saint <hi>Luke</hi> his goſpell, that our Prayers muſt be feruent and conſtant, by the example of <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 15</note> and had her requeſt for her daughter, from our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Ieſus Chriſt. And the Apoſtle in this place, teacheth that the praiers of the righteous auaile much; if they be feruent: Wherfore, as he that praieth muſt be righteous, ſo muſt his praier be feruent, earneſt, and conſtant, if hee wil obteine any thing at the hands of God.</p>
               <p>Wherence we may learne, that the wicked are out of hope of obteining for their comfort, the things they praie for: becauſe it is ſaid; that the praiers of the righteous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile much: not the praiers of the wicked: whoſe praiers being heard of God, tend to their greater and iuſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, deſtruction and puniſhment.</p>
               <p>And the praiers alſo of the righteous are then effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, when they are feruent. Let all them which hope to receaue their petitions at rhe hands of God, in all things applie themſelues to righteouſneſſe: let them not be faint
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:19545:336"/> hearted, of a wauering minde, colde in asking, eaſilie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, ſoone diſcouraged in praying: but let them be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent and conſtant therein, if they look to be regarded: for our Apoſtle affirmeth, that the praier of the righteous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth much, if it be feruent.</p>
               <p>And that the praier of the righteous auaileth much, being feruent, the Apoſtle proueth by the example of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as;</hi> at his praier the heauen was (as it were) ſhutte vp for a time: and againe, thereat opened, Whereof thus ſaith S. <hi>Iames; Elias</hi> was a man ſubiect to like paſſions as we are, and praied earneſtly that it might not raine, and it rained not on the earth for 3. yeares and 6. moneths: &amp; he praied againe, and the heauen gaue raine, and the earth brought foorth her fruite.</p>
               <p>This ſtorie touching <hi>Elias</hi> is recorded in the book of <note place="margin">3. <hi>Kings</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.</note> Kings, where it is mentioned, that in the daies of <hi>Achab</hi> &amp; <hi>Iezabel,</hi> there was great and extreame famine &amp; drought vpon the land, ſo that men periſhed for want of food, cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle died for lacke of water in the Countrey of Samaria. In which diſtreſſe, <hi>Achab</hi> and his ſeruant <hi>Obadia</hi> deuided the land, to ſeeke for water for the reſidue of their cattle and horſes, leaſt they alſo for want of water ſhould peariſh. At what time <hi>Obadiah</hi> met with <hi>Elias,</hi> &amp; <hi>Elias</hi> talked with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi> whom he councelled to make haſt, and to get home, leaſt the raine ſhould ſtay him. After which, raine enſued immediatly; in the land. Which ſtorie <hi>James</hi> here citing, faith, that <hi>Elias</hi> praied, and it rained not for 3. yeares, &amp; 6. moneths, and he praied againe, and it rained.</p>
               <p>In the ſtory there is no mention of his praier, neither for drought, neither for raine: concerning the drought, this only is ſaid; that <hi>Elias</hi> tolde <hi>Ahab</hi> the king, that there ſhould neither raine nor dewe fall, but according to his word, for certaine yeares: yet the Apoſtle ſaith he praied, and it rained not for 3. yeares and 6. moneths. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the raine, he is ſaid to haue tolde this to the king; whom he biddeth to haſte, leaſt the raine did ſtay him: he is ſaide to haue couched vpon the ground, &amp; to haue put his head and face betwixt his knees, and to haue commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded his
<pb facs="tcp:19545:337"/> ſeruante to looke to the ſea ward: but mention of his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer is none. But hereby is it manifeſte, that in both caſes he praied: when he ſaw the horrible idolatrie of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and people, and the bloudie perſecution where vnto the Church and Saintes were ſubiecte: for zeale to Gods glorie, for care ouer the church, he praied for famine and drought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord, that thereby they being puniſhed, might remember them ſelues, repente of the wickednes they had committed, and retourne vnfainedly vnto God. Whoſe prayer God heard, and brought famine &amp; drought vpon the lande for three yeares and ſixe monthes. And afterwardes, either ſeeing their repentance, or hoping for their amendement, or touched with the extremitie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto the innocent and ſillie people were ſubiect, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto God againe, and the Lorde heard him, and it rayned, and the earth brought fruite. Thus at his prayer the heauen was ſhutte for a time, and opened againe, whereby it euidently appearerh, that earneſt and feruent prayers of the righteous, are of greate force.</p>

For ſeeing inward diſeaſes as errours of our mindes, either in manners &amp; life, or in opinion and faith, are oftentimes cauſes of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde infirmities and diſeaſes of the bodie: and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle hath before ſpoken of bodily infirmities: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth directly, that hee ſpeake ſome thing touching diſeaſes of the minde and errours, howe they alſo ought to bee dealt withall: which thing in the laſt place, and laſt wordes is preſcribed. Therein two things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued: thereof the firſte is, what the Saintes ought to doe when their brethren erre and goe aſtray: they muſte doe their endeuour, and giue all diligence to reclayme, conuert, and call home ſuch as go out of the way, and erre.</p>

               <p>This is a diuine labour, this is a holy exerciſe, this is a heauenly trauaile, the labour and trauaile to purchaſe and get ſoules, and winne them to Gods holy trueth: whereunto as vnto a moſt needefull point of loue the holy Scriptures exhort vs. Wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh of this excellent labour of loue, when he ſaith, that the fruite of <note place="margin">

               <p>This Apoſtle hath exhorted Chriſtians in the former treatiſe, by prayer, confeſſion of faults, &amp; the like, to ſeeke to driue away the diſeaſes of the bodies of their brethren: how much more care ſhould we haue of driuing away the diſeaſes of their mindes?</p>

               <p n="2">2. The other profit herence riſing, is the couering &amp; hiding of the multitude of ſinnes. The manifolde ſinnes of men conuerted, are hidde in their conuerſion: ſo that
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:19545:342"/> he which conuerteth another: as hee conuerteth, ſo put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth he away, &amp; hideth the multitude of his ſinnes, which is now rightly conuerted, and turned to the knowledge of the trueth.</p>
               <p>To conuert one from his ſinne, and from going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, from out of his way, is a ſpecial point of loue. and a notable effect thereof, and it is a propertie of loue alſo, to couer ſinnes. Loue (ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> out of the wiſe <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon)</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Peter</hi> 4. <hi>Prou.</hi> 10. 12.</note> couereth the multitude of ſinnes. Wherfore, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting the brethren, wee thereby hide and couer their ſinnes alſo. And thus this double benefite redoundeth to him that is conuerted: euen the ſauing of his ſoul, and the hiding of his ſinne.</p>
               <p>Which as it is referred to the partie conuerted, ſo may it be to him which conuerteth. In the conuerting of others, he ſaueth his owne ſoule, in diſcharging ſo great a worke of loue. And men thus ſaue their ſoules, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourming <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 33.</note> of this action, as the watchman is ſaide to ſaue his ſoule, when he hath deſcried the enemie, and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the people of their danger, which hangeth ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for ſinne. And as the Miniſter, by exerciſing himſelfe in the Scriptures, and by continuing in reading, is ſaide to ſaue himſelfe, and thoſe that heare him: So men, in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</note> this duetie towards their brethren, by diſcharging a good conſcience, and perfourming ſo excellent labour of loue, doe thereby ſaue their ſoules.</p>
               <p>And as they ſaue their ſoules, ſo they hide a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their owne ſinnes, when they endeuour the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of others. For God is commonly marueylous merciful to their ſinnes, which endeuour to winne others vnto him: by which trauaile they purchaſe great fauour with the Lorde, and obteine thereby the pardon of their manifold ſinnes: wherefore S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith; they hide a mul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titude of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Albeit then this may ſtande with a iuſt proportion, and an analogie of the Scriptures: yet I thinke rather, that the firſt ought to be referred to him that is conuerted: and
<pb facs="tcp:19545:343"/> the ſecond to him that conuerteth in this wiſe: let him knowe, that hee that conuerteth a ſinner from goeing a ſtray out of his waie, ſaueth a ſoule from death, euen that ſoule which he conuerteth: And hideth a multitude of ſinnes, euen the multitude of his owne ſinnes, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God hideth, forgiueth and couereth for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceading loue he ſheweth to his brethren in their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Which ſheweth the vnſpeakeable reward which ſhalbe giuen them which ſeeke to winne other vnto God. Which thing the holy prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> long before had for <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Daniel.</hi> 12.</note> tolde: who ſpeaking of the glorious crowne of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God, and alſo of all the faithfull, which inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ignorante, bring them therby to the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God: ſaith, they that bee wiſe ſhall ſhine at the brightnes of the firmame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: &amp; the that turne many to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes, ſhall ſhine as the ſtarres for euer and euer: thus ſhall they be rewarded at the hand of God, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
